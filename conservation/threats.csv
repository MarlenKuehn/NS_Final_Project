threats
"Trade represents a significant and on-going threat to the species. It was widely trapped as early as the 19th century. In 1999, research suggested that as many as 1,000-2,000 birds were being taken from Karakelang each year, 80% (illegally) to the Philippines. This is compounded by the extensive loss of forest, perhaps the main factor underlying its disappearance from Sangihe. The reasons behind habitat loss are small-holder agricultural encroachment into primary forest and (illegal) commercial logging. Furthermore, in 2003 there were plans to develop a commercial banana plantation on Karakelang <strong></strong>(Riley 2003). The use of insecticides and the transmission of disease via escaped cage-birds to wild populations, have been identified as a further potential hazards. <p></p>"

"Its preferred habitat is relatively unlikely to be affected by human activities in the medium term, but logging and trapping must remain a concern. As a species of montane areas, it is potentially threatened in the long term by the effects of projected climate change on the distribution and extent of its habitats. <br/><p></p>"

"Avian malaria, cyclones and natural cycles are suggested causes of its fluctuating range (Diamond 1975b, Diamond and Marshall 1976, Bregulla 1992)<strong></strong>. Lowland forest, especially on small islands with high human populations, is being cleared for agriculture, domestic timber demand and commercial logging, but observations suggest that this habitat type may not be regularly used by this species (S. Totterman <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>"

"Three factors are thought to have caused its decline the past century: heavy exploitation for the cage-bird trade from the 1920s<strong></strong> to the 1960s (Moreau 1948, Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>, gradual desiccation of its habitat (Moreau 1948, Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, which is thought to be (currently) the main threat given the highly localised range of the species (Warburton 2003)<strong></strong>, and the partial replacement of sorghum and millet crops, (an attractive food source [Dodman 1995b, L. S. Warburton <em>in litt.</em> 1999, 2000]<strong></strong>), with maize, between c.1930 and 1950 (Dodman 1995c, Dodman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2000)<strong></strong>. There is evidence that the wild-caught trade in this species is currently at a very low level, with only isolated incidences of trade and export (Dodman 1995c, Warburton and Perrin 2005c)<strong></strong>, although it is clear that any international demand would be met eagerly<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Warburton and Perrin 2005a, d)<strong></strong>. Some birds are caught for subsistence consumption and it is also persecuted as a pest, however these birds would usually be eaten as well (Dodman 1995c, Warburton and Perrin 2005c<strong></strong><strong></strong>)<strong></strong>. Farmers take measures to mitigate damage to crops<strong></strong>, but they are largely ineffective and rarely lethal (Dodman 1995c, Warburton 2003)<strong></strong>. The current levels of hunting and capture are unlikely to have any serious long-term impact on the population, but could threaten local populations suffering from the effects of desiccation (Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. Recently there may have been local declines due to loss of surface water supplies in the dry season, perhaps due to long-term climate change<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Dodman 1995b, c, Warburton 1999b, Dodman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2000)<strong></strong>. The direct effect of climate change on the species's habitat may not be that great, but the indirect effect through the effect on human populations could have a large impact on the species (Segan <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;The number of permanent water sources in mopane woodland has decreased since the early 20th century<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. The low availability of water in the dry season is probably the principal factor in the disappearance of permanent populations from the Bovu and Sinde Rivers, and changes to the Ngweze River population (Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. This is exacerbated by a decrease in the annual rainfall in the species's habitat of, on average, about 5 mm per year between 1950 and 1995, increasing the species's reliance on artificial water sources (Warburton and Perrin 2005d)<strong></strong>. The recent establishment of hand-pumped boreholes along the catchments of the Ngweze, Sichifulo, and Machile rivers may lead to a decrease in the availability of surface water as people reduce their water source creation activities in riverbeds (Warburton and Perrin 2005d)<strong></strong>. In some areas, water pools are poisoned to kill fish and this can impact the species (Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. The species may be threatened by the declining dry-season availability of water in temporary rivers in south-western Zambia, due to declining levels of rainfall<strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> (T. </strong>Dodman<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Mopane woodland is exploited for firewood and timber, with large areas cleared (T. Mzumara <em>in litt. via </em>C. Downs 2016),&#160;though the habitat is regenerating and encroaching into other habitats in some areas (Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease Virus is present in the wild population (Warburton 2003, Warburton and Perrin 2005c)<strong></strong>, but there is no evidence that this is a serious threat. <p></p>"
"The species has been heavily traded: since 1981, when it was listed on CITES Appendix II, 75,239 wild-caught individuals have been recorded in international trade (UNEP-WCMC CITES Trade Database, January 2005)."
"Original forest on Sangihe has been almost completely replaced by cultivation, but the species appears to be tolerant of degraded and cultivated habitats and there is no evidence of a continuing decline. Further potential threats are the widespread clearance of large isolated trees which was linked to declines in the 1980s, disease transmitted by escaped parrots and volcanic activity in the future <strong></strong>(Riley 2002). <p></p>"

"There has been massive illegal trade in the species. At least 10,000 birds were taken from the wild in the 1980s, with 50% destined for the Brazilian market (Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 1990)<strong></strong>. In 1983-1984, over 2,500 were flown out of BahÃÂ­a Negra, Paraguay, with an additional 600 in the late 1980s (<strong></strong>J. Pryor <em>in litt</em>. 1998)<strong></strong>. Although these numbers are now much reduced, illegal trade still continues (e.g. 10 passed through a pet market in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, in August 2004-July 2005, where birds were changing hands for US$ 1,000 and were destined for Peru [Herrera and Hennessey 2007]<strong></strong>). More recently it has been noted that there appears to be almost no illegal trade in this species in Bolivia (B. Hennessey <em>in litt</em>. 2012) or Brazil (A. C. Lees <em>in litt</em>. 2015). Across its range, there is some local hunting for food and feathers. In Amazonia, there has been habitat loss for cattle-ranching and hydroelectric power schemes on the rios Tocantins and Xingu. In the Pantanal, only 5% of <em>S. apetala</em> trees have suitable cavities (<strong></strong>Guedes 1993, Johnson 1996)<strong></strong>. Young trees are foraged by cattle and burnt by frequent fires (<strong></strong>Newton 1994)<strong></strong>. The Gerais is being rapidly converted to mechanised agriculture, cattle-ranching and exotic tree plantations (<strong></strong>Conservation International 1999)<strong></strong>.

"Its decline is only partly explicable by deforestion, since it has disappeared from localities where apparently suitable habitat remains<strong> </strong>(Juniper and Parr 1998). It suffers from capture for the cage-bird trade, with 183 individuals arriving in the USA from Paraguay between 1977 and 1979 (Chebez 1994). At least in Argentina its decline could have been largely caused by persecution as a crop pest<strong> </strong>(Bodrati <em>et al. </em>2006). <p></p>"

"Extensive and continuing forest clearance is responsible for its current fragmented distribution. Its apparent tolerance of shade cacao plantations provides little hope because shading techniques since the 1980s have involved the use of banana and <em>Erythrina</em> trees, rather than standing forest, and unstable prices have resulted in conversion to pasture. Many remaining populations are now affected by site-specific threats such as conflicts between habitat conservation and the rights of local communities in Monte Pascoal National Park. Trapping for the cage-bird trade is a relatively new phenomenon, but the species is rare in national and international markets.<strong></strong><p></p>"

"<p>The range of this species is affected by deforestation, as driven primarily by the expansion of agriculture as new roads are constructed; however, deforestation  in Brazil may actually be  benefitting this species and facilitating its  spread to new areas  (Vieira da Costa <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the long term, deforestation may become so rapid and extensive that the balance of extensive forest tracts and savanna required by the species will be surpassed and the species could start to decline. Silveira <em>et al</em>. (2005) state that at Monte Alegre, ParÃÂ¡, there are no obvious indications of heavy trapping pressure. Likewise, Mittermeier <em>et al</em>.

"Habitat loss appears to be the main threat. Most forest in the coastal lowlands of Buru has now been cleared, and much of the forest in the northern part of the island has been selectively logged or degraded and fragmented by shifting agriculture, such that only a few small patches of primary lowland forest remain. Montane forest on the island is largely undisturbed, although none currently receives formal protection. There is historical documentation of some minor exploitation of the species, but around 1980 there was no evidence of any trade. It has since been observed as a cage bird on Bali in 2001 (Collar 2006)<strong></strong>. <p></p>"
"This species is widely captured and traded as a cage-bird. In Cambodia, targeted nest-robbing and capture of  adults pose the main threats, as it is one of the most sought-after species as a cage-bird (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013) and is used in 'merit releases' (Gilbert <em>et al. </em>2012). Despite the near-disappearance of the species from Thailand, nestlings  still appear in illegal  trade in Bangkok bird markets, although they  possibly originate from Cambodia (P. Round <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Illegal trade, as well as the destruction of nest-sites, threatens the species in Pakistan (S. Khan <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Likewise, it is reported that the species is threatened by extensive poaching by local tribes in Gujarat (V. Vyas <em>in litt</em>.  2013). Habitat loss and degradation are also serious threats. In Cambodia, land-use changes in the lowlands have been rapid (R. Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013) and expected rates of degradation and loss of lowland forest are  further expected to impact the species (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Rates of habitat conversion in Laos are described as severe (J. W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2013)."
"Habitat destruction through the combined impacts of firewood  collection, commercial logging, timber extraction for construction  materials, and clearance for agriculture together may represent the most  pertinent threat. The loss and fragmentation of forests is already  extensive on Flores, where no semi-evergreen forest below 1,000 m is  included within gazetted protected areas. These threats are compounded  by human population expansion, with large volumes of timber required for  housing construction, and the fact that there is little or no  governmental enforcement of laws. Moist deciduous forest is currently  being extensively cleared through land grabbing and establishment of  agricultural areas, a factor that is inevitably reducing the range and  population of this species. Forest clearance continues in the coastal  belt to make way for crops, and illegal logging continues in protected  areas. It is presumed that trapping for the wild bird trade represents a further threat, as it does for other species in the <em>T. haemotodus</em> complex)."
"The main threat stems from trapping for the cage-bird trade. This is the most popular bird exported from east Indonesia, largely owing to its strong imitative abilities. Several thousand individuals were legally taken from the wild annually during the 1980s and early 1990s, although the true figure was probably much higher. Legal trade declined through the 1990s and ceased in 2003 <strong></strong>(Poulsen <em>et al. </em>1999); however, illegal trade continues: in 2007 around 2,800 were recorded as poached and in 2008, 60 were recorded in trade in Javan bird markets <strong></strong>(R. Nursahid <span style=""font-style: italic;"">per</span> J. Gilardi <em>in litt. </em>2009). Forests within its range were largely intact at the outset of the 1990s, but exploitation by logging companies for economically valuable timber has become intensive (e.g. Vetter 2009). Important nesting-trees are targeted for extraction because of their large size, and with logging roads greatly facilitating access for trappers, this represents an increasingly significant combination of threats. <p></p>"
"On Palawan, Polillo and Samar, trapping was particularly serious, and the high price fetched per bird (c.US$160 in Manila in 1997 and US$300 in 2006) means that chicks were taken from virtually every accessible nest,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">however this trade has now virtually ceased due to the very low numbers of birds in these localities (P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2016). High numbers were (legally) traded internationally in the 1980s (e.g. 422 in 1983). Poaching of nestlings and snares possibly intended for roosting cockatoos have also been noted during initial conservation work on Pandanan Island,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">but this threat ceased due to the implementation of an intensive wildlife warden and nest protection scheme (P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2016). During nest monitoring on Pandanan, illegal tree cutting was also documented (Anon. 2010)<strong></strong>. Lowland deforestation and mangrove destruction have been extensive throughout its range, and have contributed significantly to its decline. It is also persecuted as a crop-pest and hunted for food. Typhoons are a threat, at least in already declining populations. Very dry breeding seasons may lead to partial or complete breeding failure, e.g. b<span lang=""EN-US"">reeding success on Pandanan and Rasa in 2016 was low and catastrophic on Dumaran (where all surviving nestlings were rescued) due to effects in El NiÃÂ±o<span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;(P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2016). The release of captive birds may introduce disease into the wild population. Introduced predators represent a threat at many potential release sites. Recent attempts to establish a large-scale biofuel plantation in  cockatoo habitats on Dumaran, and a coal-fired power plant in the  immediate vicinity of Rasa Island (which held c.280 individuals in 2012), were only prevented by major advocacy campaigns and remain potential threats (P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2013, Anon. 2013).&#160;Recreational activities may also play an increased role in the future, as a roost site was abandoned shortly after its location was publicised on social media (P. Widmann <em>in litt.</em> 2016).</span></span>"
"There is extensive poaching for national and (especially) international trade with 356 birds, mostly nestlings, captured during 1991-1992 breeding season in the municipality of CananÃÂ©ia (a quarter of the species's range) (Martuscelli 1994). Of 47 nests monitored between 1990 and 1994, six were naturally predated and the other 41 robbed by humans (Martuscelli 1997). Nest-cavities are virtually always damaged when removing nestlings, reducing the number available (Martuscelli 1994). There is continuing habitat loss for boat building, banana plantations, cattle- and buffalo-grazing and beach houses<strong></strong> (Lalime 1999, Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. Palmito palms are cut for processing in GuaraqueÃÂ§aba<strong></strong> (Lalime 1999). The proposed construction of a bridge to Ilha Comprida will increase pressure from tourism and habitat conversion (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000). Tourist boats in the vicinity of nesting or roosting areas may cause disturbance (Schunk <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><p></p>"
"The major threat is hunting for feathers (Coates 1985, Beehler <em>et al.</em> 1986, Mack and Wright 1998), which are used for ornamentation, particularly in ceremonial head-dresses, in much of the Papua New Guinea Highlands and, in some areas, for skins, which are used as bride prices (Schmid 1993). Demand may increase as the population grows, however, the plumes of this species are not worn as commonly as those of other birds (M. Supuma <em>in litt.</em> 2012) and many feathers may be decades old as they tend to be carefully stored when not being used (B. Beehler<em> in litt. </em>2012). In addition, hunting levels potentially have decreased since the introduction of a law preventing the killing of birds with non-traditional means (i.e. shotguns) (G. Dutson <em>in litt. </em>2016). Tourist shows and cultural events have however increased in recent years, which may increase demand for plumes, and birds or feathers are occasionally sold to tourists (van den Bergh 2009) although it is illegal to take them out of the country. Despite demand being generally lower in Papua, birds are also hunted for the cage-bird trade and meat (Nash 1992, K. D. Bishop <em>in litt. </em>1994). Nestlings are captured by felling trees or enlarging nest-cavities, and the scarcity of suitable nest-sites could become a limiting factor. Deforestation is a less major threat to the species since loggers usually leave fig trees (B. Beehler <em>in litt.</em> 2007) and encounter rates for the species are often similar in logged forest (I. Woxvold <em>per </em>G. Dutson <em>in litt.</em> 2016).<p></p>"
"Forest clearance has been extensive, affecting most of the ""matas de tabuleiro"" in Bahia and Espirito Santo.

"In 1984-1991, 38% of Paraguay's Atlantic forests disappeared<strong></strong> (Huespe Fatecha<em> et al</em>. 1994), and range contractions in Brazil presumably result from similarly extensive deforestation. There is some correlation with the disappearance of <em>Araucaria</em> forest e.g. in ParanÃÂ¡, 73,780 km<sup>2</sup> of <em>Araucaria</em> forest was reduced to 15,932 km<sup>2</sup> in 1965<strong> </strong>(Hueck 1978). Selective logging, colonisation and plantation agriculture threaten remaining forests (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 1995). However, in Argentina, <em>Amazona vinacea</em> has disappeared from large forest reserves (e.g. the 1,500 km<sup>2</sup> IguazÃÂº-Urugua-ÃÂ­ forest complex), remaining mostly in the mosaic of small farms and degraded forest remnants between San Pedro and Santa Rosa. There, where the wild population numbers approximately 200 individuals, 40 individuals were found in captivity in 35 homes between 2003 and 2005<strong> </strong>(Cockle <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. &#160; In 2006 and 2007, from twelve nests identified in this area, only one chick fledged; at least three nests were predated, at least two were flooded during storms, and at three nests the chicks were captured for sale to Brazil<strong> </strong>(Proyecto Selva de Pino ParanÃÂ¡ <em>in litt. </em>2007). In the anthropogenic habitat that <em>A. vinacea</em> selects in Argentina, there appear to be few appropriate nest cavities, and most nests are in large, shallow, cavities which are easily predated or flooded during storms<strong> </strong>(Proyecto Selva de Pino ParanÃÂ¡ <em>in litt. </em>2007). Furthermore, the species appears to be very conservative in selecting nest sites, returning year after year to cavities that continually fail<strong> </strong>(Proyecto Selva de Pino ParanÃÂ¡ <em>in litt. </em>2007). &#160;Interviews in 2015 - 2016 suggested that nest poaching continues to be a problem in Argentina (K. Cockle&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). &#160;Competition with other hole nesting animals may also be important: in the above mentioned nests in Argentina in 2007, <em>A. vinacea</em> apparently lost competitions for nest cavities with exotic honeybees, possums, and several species of hole-nesting birds, apparently during the incubation stage<strong> </strong>(Proyecto Selva de Pino ParanÃÂ¡ <em>in litt. </em>2007). Internal trade has probably affected Brazilian and Argentine populations, and one massive bird-smuggling operation was centred in Paraguay and included <em>A. vinacea</em> (Endangered Species Bull. 1995 20[2]:7). The species was also shot as a crop pest in certain areas<strong> </strong>(White 1882<strong>, </strong>Chebez 1992), but this does not appear to be an important threat today (Cockle <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><p></p>"
"Less than 10% of original forest cover remains in Bahia and EspÃÂ­rito Santo, and only 2% in Alagoas<strong> </strong>(Brown and Brown 1992, Conservation International 1995)<strong></strong>, primarily because of conversion to plantations and pastureland. Indeed, less than 1% of this species's overall habitat is now estimated to remain (Klemann-JÃÂºnior <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). In Rio de Janeiro, many important habitat fragments are being cleared, notably around Desengano State Park. The collapse of the cocoa economy in south Bahia has resulted in increased logging by landowners and the colonisation of reserves by former plantation workers (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000). If the seasonal displacement of birds is confirmed, this would multiply the problems of habitat loss. In the 1998-1999 breeding season, 174 nestlings were poached, mostly from reserves, for the national and international cage-bird trade<strong> </strong>(Brown and Brown 1992), while 664 individuals were recorded in captivity at the Centre for Reintroduction of Wild Animals in 2005-2006 and others were found in private cages<strong> </strong>(L. Klemann-JÃÂºnior <em>in litt. </em>2007). Illegal trade is apparently the overriding threat to the species in EspÃÂ­rito Santo (Klemann-JÃÂºnior <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008b).&#160; Souvenirs containing feathers have been seen for sale outside Monte Pascoal National Park<strong></strong> (Sweeney 1996). It is considered a pest species in some papaya, coffee and cocoa plantations<strong> </strong>(Klemann-JÃÂºnior  2006, L. Klemann-JÃÂºnior <em>in litt. </em>2012). <p></p>"

"Up until its partial protection in the early 1970s, over 150,000 were shot in a bounty scheme, established because rogue individuals were found to be attacking sheep as a source of fat. Deforestation for pasture has placed pressure on the species, and farmers still kill an unknown number of birds each year (Mosen 2009). Introduced mammalian predators such as stoats <em>Mustela erminea</em>, cats and brush-tailed possums <em>Trichosurus vulpecula</em> have spread into most of the species's range. Episodic, high mortality events are thought to be associated with Ã¢ÂÂplaguesÃ¢ÂÂ of stoats <em>Mustela erminea</em> which occur after mast seeding of native beech and rimu (Kemp 2013). Monitoring by the Department of Conservation between 2009-2014 found that only 2% of kea nests in areas without pest control were successful, in contrast with a 27% success rate&#160;in areas treated with aerial 1080 in 2015 (Department of Conservation 2016). It is estimated that around 60% of kea nests are normally attacked by predators, especially stoats, which may also kill adults; this can rise to as many as 99% of nests being attacked in a stoat Ã¢ÂÂplagueÃ¢ÂÂ (Department of Conservation 2016). Birds are sometimes killed through accidents with human objects (e.g. motor vehicles, snow groomers, rubbish bins, electricity sub-stations) (Orr-Walker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Ingestion of lead from building components and the 1080 toxin used in invasive control have potentially widespread impacts on the population (T. Orr-Walker <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2008; Reid <em>et al.</em> 2012; Orr-Walker 2013a; van Klink &amp; Crowell 2015). Climate change may pose a threat through possible future influences on its high altitude habitat (Mosen 2009)."
"Virtually no primary forest remains on the island of Sibutu and there is little forest remaining on Sanga-sanga. By the mid-1990s, the rapid clearance of primary forest on Tawi-Tawi had rendered remaining lowland patches highly degraded. Logging of the few remaining tracts, now confined to rugged mountainous areas, is likely to be followed by uncontrolled settlement and conversion to agriculture. Mining operations also potentially threaten the species's remaining habitat (D. Allen <em>in litt. </em>2016). The tameness of this parrot, combined with the high rate of gun ownership in its range, have made it an easy target in the past. As of January 2012, logging was said to be on-going (R. Hutchinson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012), and hunting pressure on hornbills was increasing,  suggesting that other species may be suffering from increased  persecution (I. Sarenas <em>in litt</em>. 2010). Claims that the species is captured for trade to Indonesia have not been confirmed, and the species is apparently not favoured as a pet because it cannot be sustained on rice (D. Allen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012).<br/><p></p>"
"Lowland and hill forest is slowly being cleared in much of Fiji. However, the rarity and assumed decline of this species is probably largely the result of predation by introduced mammals, especially Black Rat <em>Rattus rattus</em>, as is the case with the closely-related New Caledonian Lorikeet <em>C. diadema</em>, which could be extinct owing to predation by rats. Ongoing increases in logging, expansion of the road network, especially around the high-altitude areas of Monasavu and Serua in Viti Levu, are likely to be increasing rat density (Watling 2000, G. Dutson <em>in litt. </em>2005<strong></strong>)<strong></strong>. The introduced Small Indian Mongoose <em>Herpestes&#160;</em><em>auropunctatus</em>&#160;and feral cats are also present in the species's range and may pose a threat (V. Masibalavu<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2012, Watling 2013). Agricultural expansion is encroaching on primary forest in Taveuni. Having a montane distribution that is close to the maximum altitude within its range, this species is also potentially susceptible to climate change (BirdLife International unpublished data)<strong></strong>.<br/><p></p>"
"Range contraction is largely the result of clearing for agriculture. Decreases in the species's abundance are linked to land clearing that does not leave scattered trees in the landscape (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Remaining habitat is often fragmented, with feeding and breeding habitats divided. Regeneration is commonly prevented by high grazing levels by stock and rabbits or inappropriate fire regimes. Scattered box-gum woodland is threatened by limited regeneration, rural tree dieback, removal of trees and firewood collection (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In breeding areas the majority of nest trees are often on private land, with scattered paddock trees in mixed agricultural land of vital importance on the South-West Slopes. Nest-site fidelity means that birds continue to use traditional breeding sites despite habitat loss and degradation (Leslie 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Many nest trees are dead, particularly on inland slopes, and have no replacements when they fall or are cut for firewood, potentially resulting in competition with other species, particularly the Common Starling <em>Sturnus vulgaris</em>. There are limited provisions for the protection of dead trees, and due to continued illegal removal and natural loss of old trees a decline in nest site availability is inevitable (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In areas of low occupancy, the availability of food in the breeding season, and not that of nest hollows, may limit population size (Leslie 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In the Riverina, altered flooding regimes may compromise the health and extent of riparian woodlands where this species nests (C. Tzaros and M. A. Weston <em>in litt. </em>2003)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Illegal trapping occurs, but is a far less significant threat than habitat loss. Birds are also killed on roadsides and possibly suffer from pesticide poisoning. The abundance and distribution of the species appears to be affected by changes in plant productivity, as influenced by climate (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It is therefore susceptible to climate change and its interaction with fragmentation (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.  <p></p>"
Forests throughout its range are threatened by commercial logging but the species's abundance in secondary forest suggests that it is not threatened (B. Whitney in litt. 2000).

"Nest predation by Sugar Gliders&#160;<em>Petaurus breviceps</em> introduced to Tasmania&#160;poses a severe threat (Stojanovic&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) and is estimated to cause severe declines over the next three generations (Heinsohn <em>et al.</em> 2015). Surveys revealed that&#160;Sugar Gliders&#160;predated nests and the probability of a nest surviving the 60-day nesting period when&#160;Sugar Gliders&#160;were present was 0.17&#160;(Stojanovic&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). On mainland Tasmania almost 79% nests were predated and 65% of adult females were killed by Sugar Gliders. Predation was most severe in locations with low forest cover. Owing to the fact that Swift Parrot breeding distribution varies widely between years the extent of nest predation is also expected to vary annually depending on the distribution of&#160;Sugar Gliders&#160;and forest cover. Sugar Gliders have not been reported from Bruny Island, a Swift Parrot breeding site.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and alteration within breeding and drought refuge habitats remains a key threat. In Tasmania, breeding habitat is significantly reduced and fragmented through clearance of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. globulus</span> for agriculture, residential development, plantation timber, sawlog production and clear-felling for woodchips. In 2017, a large area of key nesting habitat has been logged for timber extraction (D. Stojanovic <em>in litt</em>. 2017). Over 50% of the original grassy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. globulus</span> forest in Tasmania has been cleared (Brereton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004). Selective logging has resulted in the removal of larger trees from the remaining forest patches. Such patches are typically unfenced and exhibit poor regeneration (Brereton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004). Competition for remaining nest-sites with Common Starlings <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sturnus vulgaris</span> could be a problem along forest edges. Even with protection of remaining habitat (80% private land), maintenance and recovery may be limited by the dependence of breeding on an irregular nectar supply. It also suffers high mortality through collision with windows, vehicles and fences. On the mainland, clearance and degradation of habitat for agriculture, forestry and residential and commercial development has had the biggest impact (D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2007). Much of the preferred lowland habitat on the most fertile and productive sites has been cleared or substantially modified (C. Tzaros <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2003). Drought refuge habitats continue to be cleared and fragmented for coastal developments (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Remnants, including much of what currently exists in the conservation reserve system, have been heavily cut-over and degraded, and this practice is continuing in many areas, including hardwood production forests. This practice is considered to result in poor and unreliable nectar-sources through the reduction of large mature trees. Competition from large nectarivores honeyeaters and the introduced Bumblebee <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bombus terrestris </span>may be exacerbated by forest fragmentation. In winter, the species relies heavily on public land that has been exploited for timber, honey and minerals (Kennedy and Tzaros 2005).&#160;<br/><br/>Global warming threatens to alter habitat phenology and climatic conditions such that habitat availability may be significantly reduced (D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;in litt.</span>&#160;2007). The species is also threatened by disturbance, Psittacine beak and feather disease and illegal bird capture and trade (D. Saunders&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Furthermore, the species seems to be very susceptible to Allee effects, where survival and reproductive success decline with decreasing population density, which might even accelerate the population decline (Crates <em>et al</em>. 2017)."
"The impact of introduced predators, principally stoats <em>Mustela erminea</em> and rats <em>Rattus</em> spp., is likely to be the primary cause of decline (Higgins 1999)<strong></strong>, with recent population crashes being due to rat irruptions. The species's hole-nesting behaviour leads to a reduced ratio of females in the population due to predation of birds on the nest (Elliott <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. Silviculture of beech forests aims to harvest trees at an age when few will be mature enough to develop suitable cavities, so sufficient nest holes are unlikely in managed beech forest (Kearwell 2002)<strong></strong>. The species forages in low-growing shrubs and such lower forest levels have been subject to heavy browsing by cattle, deer and possums, altering the forest structure (Duncan and van Hal 2004)<strong></strong>. The population on Chalky Island may suffer competition from&#160;Yellow-crowned Parakeet&#160;<em>C. auriceps </em>(J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2011) and in time, this problem may affect other island populations. Population growth in island populations, especially on Maud Island, may also be limited through predation by falcons (Falconidae), and displacement of two nesting pairs by introduced Common Starlings <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sturnus vulgaris</span> has now been documented; the overall impact of this recently-identified threat is uncertain, but may be minimal (J. C. Kearvell<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2012, 2013). <br/><br/>In 2008, it was confirmed that native Red-crowned Parakeets <em>C. novaezelandiae</em> on Little Barrier Island were suffering from psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD). The virus has been sequenced and appears very similar to the strain found in Crimson Rosella <em>Platycercus elegans</em>, in which the disease is known to be endemic within the captive population. In 2009, some individuals of <em>C. malherbi</em> on Maud Island were showing some symptoms consistent with PBFD. In reaction, testing of the entire captive population has been undertaken, as well as more limited sampling of individuals in all three island populations, as well as other parrot species. Results indicate that antibodies for PBFD were detected in <em>C. malherbi</em> from both Maud Island and the captive-rearing unit; notably in the latter case antibodies were found in the <em>C. novaezelandiae</em> foster parents (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2011), and the disease has now been found in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. auriceps</span> in the Eglington Valley, Fiordland (J. C. Kearvell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012, 2013). Monitoring for the disease in the captive population continues and the main captive breeding unit has now been declared disease-free (T. Greene <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Individuals&#160;<span lang=""EN-NZ"">at all three mainland sites and on Tuhua were seen to be in very poor feather condition in 2012/2013, with a major infestation of <span lang=""EN-NZ""><em>Dermanyssus </em>mites having occurred on Tuhua.

C. Kearvell <em>in litt. </em>2013).<br/></span></span>"
"The primary reason for the species's rarity is thought to be its specialist habitat requirements, and fragmentation and degradation of winter habitat by grazing, agriculture and urban and industrial development. Changes have also occurred in the breeding habitat, where there has been reduction of fire, which would normally produce favourable habitat structure for the species. Up until the 1990s, fire was regularly used by small-scale tin miners to reduce vegetation cover to aid mining and protect assets, coincidentally producing high quality foraging habitat for the species. Management of the area is now subject to stricter use of fire by the land manager and due to a combination of lack of resources and risk aversion, habitat management burns have rarely been implemented. This has resulted in a gradual decline in the habitat quality for the species. Disease is an important threat to the tiny population. An outbreak of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) in 2015 infected 19 out of 26 wild Orange-bellied Parrot nestlings tested (Anon. 2015). One adult also tested positive for the disease. This contributed to a decline in the wild population from 35 to 23 mature individuals in 2016. Competition with introduced seed-eating finches may have affected winter food availability, while some former breeding habitat may have been vacated because of a change in the fire regime and competition with introduced Common Starlings <em>Sturnus vulgaris</em>, which fill nest-hollows with nesting material, rendering them unsuitable. The introduced Sugar Glider <em>Petaurus breviceps</em> is also implicated as a predator of incubating females, eggs and nestlings during the Birch's Inlet release and is a known threat to other species including the Swift Parrot (Stojanovic <em>et al</em>. 2014). Sugar Gliders are absent from Melaleuca and therefore may have had an influence on the contraction of the breeding range. Deaths from random events, such as predation by foxes and cats, or disease, are significant threats to such a tiny population. Ongoing degradation of remaining saltmarsh habitat on the mainland is a significant threat (C. Tzaros and M.A. Weston <em>in litt. </em>2003). A ten-year drought reduced productivity of saltmarsh plants in the winter habitat, reducing the breeding condition of females.&#160;Windfarm developments may kill about one bird per year (Smales <em>et al. </em>2005). Due to the low population size, the species is highly susceptible to genetic Allee effects, which might lead to further population reductions (Crates <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><p></p>"

"Clearance of feeding and breeding habitat has substantially reduced the population of leadbeateri in the southern and eastern parts of its range, and is continuing. Grazing and weed invasion are also impeding recruitment of trees that could be used for breeding in the future.

Subspecies mollis is probably largely unaffected by these threats (Garnett and Crowley 2000)."

"Habitat destruction and fragmentation as a result of road construction, subsequent development and settlement, with accompanying illegal logging, are threats in the east of its range. Selective logging of primary hardwoods removes suitable roosting and nesting cavities (Yamashita 2003).<strong></strong> However, the species is not as forest-dependent as several other  non-threatened Psittacid species in the region, and it is capable of  commuting between  multiple forest-patches and moving around non-forest  landscapes (A. C. Lees <em>in litt</em>. 2013). In addition, the majority of remaining suitable habitat is not as   fragmented as originally thought and much of this is under  protection  (de Luca <em>et  al</em>. 2009). Nevertheless, projected rates of deforestation within its range, based on forecasts of infrastructure development (Soares-Filho <em>et al</em>. 2006), suggest that the species will be impacted over the coming decades (Bird <em>et al</em>. 2011). It has been extensively trapped for trade, but, although some illegal trade persists, this is no longer a major concern as trade is now usually within the substantial captive population, and does not have a significant impact on the wild population (L. F. Silveira <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012, A. C. Lees <em>in litt</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><br/><p></p>"
"Overall, the area and quality of this species's habitats are in continuing and projected  decline owing to the impacts of introduced species across its range  (Gula <em>et al. </em>2010, Garnett <em>et al</em>. 2011), forest  management practices and expected nickel mining on New Caledonia.  On-going declines are inferred to be taking place in the population as a  result of habitat loss, introduced predators (e.g. on New Caledonia and  Stewart Island [G. Harper <em>in litt.</em> 2005, 2012; Harper 2009]), and potentially owing to Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (Ortiz-Catedral <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The nominate subspecies is adversely affected by forestry operations: clear-felling and burning have drastically reduced available habitat, and selective logging may reduce the number of trees with suitable nesting holes and foraging opportunities. Irruptions in the 19th century may have been caused by increased cultivation of crops by European settlers. It was hunted for food by Maori, and was formerly persecuted because birds damaged crops and gardens. It may suffer through competition for food or breeding sites with introduced species (such as the Common Myna <em>Acridotheres tristis</em>, Common Starling <em>Sturnus vulgaris</em>, Eastern Rosella <em>Platycercus eximius</em>, Crimson Rosella <em>P. elegans</em>, common brushtail possums <em>Trichosurus vulpecula </em>and honey bees <em>Apis mellifera</em>). Introduced predators such as cats, rats and stoats may also impact the species. An outbreak of beak-and-feather disease has been confirmed in the population on Little Barrier Island. This has the potential to cause significant mortality, although effects on the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. novaezelandiae</span> population have not yet been studied (Ortiz-Catedral <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).<br/><br/>Subspecies <em>cookii</em> has been affected by the clearance of forests before 1950, for timber, agriculture and pasture,  severely reducing suitable habitat. Since then, increasing weed invasion  has dramatically altered the structure and composition of remaining  native vegetation. The degradation of native plant communities has been  linked with a reduction in the nutrient input to the island, caused by  the decimation of formerly large populations of burrow-nesting seabirds  by introduced mammalian predators (Holdaway in prep.). Though forest  clearance has stopped, recovery requires new habitat to become  available. Nest-site availability has been further reduced by  competition with introduced Crimson Rosella <em>Platycercus elegans</em> and, to a lesser extent, Common Starling <em>Sturnus vulgaris </em>and feral honey bees. Most known nest failures have resulted from predation by introduced black rats <em>Rattus rattus</em>.  Feral cats are also thought to be significant predators and, although  the level of predation is unquantified, anecdotal reports have been  alarming (M. Christian<em> in litt.</em> 2007). There is a high level of Psittacine Circoviral Disease (PCD) in the population, which has resulted in some mortality.<br/><br/>Subspecies <em>saisseti</em> is only common in the south of New Caledonia, in sites at risk from nickel mining, and so  may suffer significant habitat loss in the near future.

"It is likely that black rat <em>Rattus rattus</em> is responsible for its decline, being present on Tahuata, Hiva Oa and Nuku Hiva since c.1915, on Ua Pou (probably) since 1980, and confirmed, for the first time, on Fatu Hiva in February 2000 (Thibault and Meyer 2000) - the bird is now extinct on all of these islands<strong></strong>.&#160;If black rats colonise Ua Huka, the lorikeet would probably decline almost to extinction within 20 years (Ziembicki and Raust 2004)<strong></strong>. A project to improve the size of the wharf in one village may increase the risk of introduction of rats (P. Raust <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2017).

"The principal threat to this species is believed to come from ongoing trapping for illegal local and national trade<strong></strong> (C. Albano <em>in litt</em>. 2006, Anon. 2009; GirÃÂ£o and Albano 2008) and captive-breeding (Fernandes-Ferreira <em>et al</em>. 2012). The species occurs in the international cage bird trade. However, there has been a notable decrease in the illegal capture and trade of the species, possibly as a result of the ongoing education programme (F. Nunes <em>in litt. </em>2016). &#160;Habitat destruction has played a role in the species's decline with original forest cover now reduced to just 13%. Coffee plantations (especially where sun coffee is grown instead of shade coffee) are impacting upon the species's habitat.&#160;&#160;Lack of natural nest sites, and nest predators (bees, wasps and small mammals) are also thought to be limiting the species's reproductive success (Campos&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><p></p>"

"Subspecies <em>brevipes</em> is threatened mainly by erosion, habitat degradation and the inhibition of forest regeneration caused by heavy sheep-grazing, which is compounded by habitat damage caused by locust outbreaks (J.

"<p>The species is threatened by trapping for the cagebird trade and habitat destruction. In the period 1983-1989, over 3,000 individuals were recorded in trade per year. However, field surveys found the species to be still common, and past catch-rates were deemed unlikely to have caused population declines. Tracewski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2016) measured the forest loss within the speciesÃ¢ÂÂs range between 2000 and 2012 as c. 58 km<sup>2</sup>. This roughly equates to a rate of forest loss of 4.5% over three generations (21 years) for the species. Blue-streaked Lory seems to prefer secondary forest and plantations over primary forest (Collar and Boesman 2019), so forest loss alone may not drive a significant population decline.&#160;</p>  <p></p>"
"The species is trapped for the cage-bird trade in moderately large numbers. A further cause of population decline is the destruction of forests, particularly in the aftermath of the tsunami in 2004, which destroyed large tracts of coastal forests; however, data remains sparse and the rate of regeneration of these forests in unknown (K. Sivakumar <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Furthermore, increased settlement of the islands exerts a pressure on natural resources, and planned development projects could severely affect the habitat of this species. For now however, large tracts of forests remain on the islands (Global Forest Watch 2014).<p></p>"
"In 1970-1982, 16,490 birds (mostly nestlings) were legally imported into the USA. Illegal exports from Mexico and a pre-export mortality of &gt;50% equates to 5,000 birds per year (Enkerlin-Hoeflich and Hogan 1997)<strong></strong>. Trappers damage nests when extracting chicks (sometimes felling entire trees), reducing nest-site availability and leading to permanent site abandonment (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. <br/>Many gallery forests have been cleared or degraded, with over 80% of Tamaulipas lowlands cleared for agriculture (especially sorghum) and pasture. Tree cover loss within the range is currently estimated at 7% over three generations (Global Forest Watch 2021). Habitat is now patchily distributed on cattle-ranches, where trapping pressure is greatest (Enkerlin-Hoeflich and Hogan 1997)<strong></strong>. <br/>Urban intensification may also present a threat to this species as despite the establishment of urban populations, removal of dead palms by landscapers could harm the species (K. Berg <em>in litt. </em>2016), and widespread poaching of chicks from well-known urban nest sites could significantly harm these populations in the future (K. Berg <em>in litt. </em>2016).<p></p>"
"The decline of the species has generally been attributed to two principal factors. First, long-term destruction of the specific gallery woodland habitat on which the species apparently depended, the result of the colonisation and exploitation of the region along the rio SÃÂ£o Francisco corridor during more than three centuries. Secondly, trapping for the illegal live bird trade in recent decades pushed the species towards extinction. In addition, the colonisation of the distributional range by introduced aggressive African bees, and the building of the Sobradinho hydroelectric dam above Juazeiro may have contributed, perhaps significantly, to the species's decline in the 1970s and 1980s. Direct hunting is considered a factor of minor importance in the overall decline (Barros <em>et. al.</em>&#160;2012), even though several reports of shooting are on record. The remaining caatinga habitat has suffered degradation and clearance as a result of grazing by cattle and goats (Barros <em>et. al.</em>&#160;2012)."
"This species's earlier decline and contracting distribution corresponds to the severe destruction and degradation of its native habitat (Jones 1987, Greenwood 1996<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The population crashed from a likely total of several thousand following forest destruction and the replacement of its favoured feeding habitat, upland dwarf forest, with plantations (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. In 1996, only 5% of the island was covered with native vegetation (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. The areas of upland native forest that remain continue to be highly degraded by cyclones, the influences of past forestry practices, the spread of introduced plants such as guava <em>Psidium cattleianum</em>, privet <em>Ligustrum robustum</em> and jamrosa <em>Syzygium jambos</em> and the effect of introduced feral mammals such as pigs <em>Sus scrofa</em> and rusa deer <em>Rusa timorensis</em> (Greenwood 1996<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">,</span> Thorsen and Jones 1998)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The production of native fruit, on which the parakeet feeds, and regeneration of potential nest trees is thus poor (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong>. Recent research suggests that food shortage due to deterioration of the native forest is the major cause of nest failure; although exotics can provide an abundant food source it is not available year-round or even throughout the breeding season (Thorsen and Jones 1998)<strong></strong>. Crab-eating macaques <em>Macaca fascicularis</em> and black rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> are amongst a number of introduced arboreal species which pose a threat to parakeets by raiding nests and competing for native fruits (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong>. Bees <em>Apis mellifera</em>, yellow wasps <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Polistes hebraeus</span>, paper wasps, termites,<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>White-tailed Tropicbirds <em>Phaethon lepturus</em>, introduced Common Mynas <em>Acridotheres tristis</em> and Ring-necked Parakeets <em>Psittacula krameri</em> are all nest site competitors and can displace active breeding pairs (Thorsen and Jones 1998<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">, </span><strong></strong> C. Jones <em>in litt.</em> 2000, V. Tatayah <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012)<strong></strong>. The decline in the number of old native trees, which are lost to storm damage and senescence, has intensified competition for nesting cavities, with 14-19% of <em>P. eques</em> cavities lost to competitors each year (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. Infestations of nest fly larvae can be severe in some years and, without intervention, would kill many young (C. Jones <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. Despite the rapid outbreak of a novel genotype of the virus that causes Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) in the 2004/2005 season (Kundu&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), the impact of the disease on the population appears to have been thus far negligible, limited to a brief reduction in hatching success (Tollington&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).<p></p>"
"The species has been heavily traded and wild-caught individuals have been recorded in international trade before it was listed on CITES Appendix II (UNEP-WCMC CITES Trade Database). Between 1981 and 2004, almost 77,000 wild-caught individuals were recorded in international trade (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). Heavy domestic trade in this species has been noted in Venezuela (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997). Persecution because of its status as a crop pest may also be  contributing to the decline. <br/><br/>Although this species shows flexible habitat use and tolerates forest loss at least locally, it is suspected that land-use change is contributing to a decline in the population size, particularly in Colombia (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><span class=""ToggleUp"">"
"Settlement of the major river basins within its range was presumably accompanied by the widespread loss of palm-groves, either through direct clearance for agriculture or the suppression of regeneration by colonists' cattle. Yatay palm, which the species probably fed on, was targeted for clearance by early colonists as it is an indicator of good soil quality (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2014). Widespread loss of gallery forests could also have had an impact on the species (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2014). The size and appearance of the bird probably made it a significant target for hunters, and even the taking of young as pets could have been important. There is some evidence that it was traded, but little to support various claims that there has been recent trade in live specimens. Any current trade in eggs, skins or live specimens would obviously be extremely harmful. <strong></strong><p></p>"
"It is one of the most popular avian pets in Europe, the United States,  and the Middle East due to its longevity and unparalleled ability to  mimic human speech and other sounds. Demand for wild birds is also  increasing in China, and increased presence of Chinese businesses in  central Africa (particularly for mining, oil and logging) may increase  illegal exports of this species (<strong></strong>F. Maisels <em>in litt.</em> 2006; H. Rainey <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. From 1982 to 2001, over 1.3 million wild-caught individuals of both <span style=""font-style: italic;"">erithacus </span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">timneh</span> (the vast majority <span style=""font-style: italic;"">erithacus</span>) entered international trade (UNEP-WCMC 2016), and considering the pre-trade mortality can be 30-66% (Fotso 1998a, b; McGowan 2001; Hart 2013), the number collected could far exceed this figure (Martin <em>et al. </em>2014; R. Martin <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). During 1984 Ã¢ÂÂ 1992, more than 50,000 individual wild birds were traded annually (UNEP-WCMC 2016). In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Cameroon exported an annual quota of 10,000 birds; estimates that c.90% of trapped birds died before reaching Douala airport suggest that some 100,000 birds per year were being captured in Cameroon during that period (F. Dowsett-Lemaire <em>in litt. </em>2012).  Official statistics give exports of 367,166 individuals from Cameroon in the period 1981-2005, and the country accounted for 48% of exports between 1990-1996 (Waugh 2010).&#160;Up to 10,000 wild-caught birds from the Democratic Republic of the Congo  are apparently imported into South Africa each year (S. Boyes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2011).&#160;There has been a reduction in the trade of this species, partly due to extra trade restrictions, but also due to population declines, which leads collectors to move onto populations previously not harvested (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016). The majority of legal exports are now from central Africa, and difficulties regulating trade mean that quotas have been regularly exceeded (CITES 2016). In addition, illegal international trafficking occurs but levels are difficult to quantify (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/>Because the species concentrates in traditional nesting, roosting, drinking and mineral lick sites, it is especially vulnerable to trapping pressure. Habitat loss is undoubtedly having significant impacts, particularly throughout West and East Africa. In addition to capture for international trade, there is an active internal trade in live birds for pets and exhibition (McGowan 2001; Clemmons 2003; A. Michels <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). The species is also hunted in parts of the range as bushmeat and to supply heads, legs and tail feathers for use as medicine or in black magic (Fotso 1998a; McGowan 2001; Clemmons 2003; A. Michels <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). Forest loss is also negatively impacting populations, and is considered to have contributed to declines in Ghana and may be a larger threat than the pet trade in Cameroon (Tamungang and Cheke 2012; Annorbah <em>et al.</em> 2016). The loss of large trees with nesting cavities may be particularly detrimental. Although some observers have noted populations are associated with primary forest (D<span class=""page_assessment_classScheme_content"">ÃÂ¤ndliker 1992a; Juste 1996; <span class=""page_assessment_classScheme_content""><span class=""page_assessment_classScheme_content"">Clemmons 2003), permanent populations in semi-urban areas, and its frequent use of farm-bush, plantations and secondary forest suggest this species may be robust to some habitat change (Tamungang and Cheke 2012; R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2014).</span>"
"Expert opinion of six studied populations indicated that the main threats to the species are agro-industry farming, wood and pulp plantations, agro-industry grazing, capture for the pet trade (local and international), large-scale and selective logging and climate change (Berkunsky <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017a).<br/><br/>The species is very heavily trapped for the cage-bird trade, but the impact on populations is not known. Minimum net exports rose from 10,600 in 1981 to 58,500 in 1988, but declined after that (Collar <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Large numbers of individuals continue to be traded illegally within countries (Pires <em>et al. </em>2016, Ortiz-von Halle 2018).&#160;Hundreds of individuals are captured in Brazil every year and nesting sites are frequently destroyed, with many traded between states, and the species is commonly received by government wildlife rehabilitation centres (Schunk&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). Data shows that 1,200 individuals were seized by or handed to authorities between 2004 and 2006 (COEFA/IBAMA 2008), although this figure is considered to be an underestimate of the true number of Turquoise-fronted Amazons seized and an additional 503 individuals were received by a state wildlife rehabilitation during the same period (ICMBio 2010). In Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, Turquoise-fronted Amazon is the species most frequently rescued by the authorities (Seixas and Mourao 2000); around 6,500 nestlings were seized by the environmental enforcement agencies since 1988 (900 in 2008 alone), and it is estimated that the total number of birds poached from the wild is two-three times higher (Blue-fronted Amazon Project n.d.). According to J. Tella <em>in litt.</em>&#160;(2015), 30,000 birds are captured annually. In Argentina, the National Fauna Authority coordinated the capture of more than 20,000 nestlings and 5,400 adults from the Chaco forest between 1998 and 2012, based on quotas derived from the number of individuals believed to die of natural causes (Berkunsky <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017b). However, a study by&#160;Berkunsky<em> et al.</em> (2017b) found that harvested individuals are generally removed from nests at a later stage than that when much of the natural mortality occurs, meaning that harvested parrots largely do not represent individuals that would otherwise have died of natural causes. A survey of a major illegal wildlife market in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, recorded 1,296 individuals being traded across 2005, 80.7% of which were adult birds (Pires <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>Other potential threats include habitat loss and degradation through selective cutting of <em>Schinopsis</em> trees, overgrazing by domestic livestock, forest clearance by cutting and burning for conversion to pasture and arable agriculture, and oil exploration activities&#160;(Schunk&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). A decline in the numbers of fledglings recorded across five communal roosts in the Pantanal from 2004-2009 was attributed to the cutting and burning of woody vegetation&#160;(Seixas and MourÃÂ£o 2018). A study of land cover change in the Chaco region estimated that 20.7% of the natural area was transformed between 1976 and 2012, largely through conversion to croplands and pasture (Vallejos <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015)."
"This species has been strongly threatened by trade in the past but this pressure has declined significantly since the late 1980s. The species is CITES II listed and trade is now minimal throughout its range, however the species remains susceptible to hunting and trapping (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2019). <em>P. melanura</em>&#160;is also threatened by habitat loss from deforestation throughout its range. It is suspected to lose 6.95-7.1% of suitable habitat within its distribution over three generations (18 years) based on a model of Amazonian deforestation (Soares-Filho&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Bird&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011)."
"The two largest threats faced by <em>E. polychloros</em>&#160;are habitat loss, a direct result of increased deforestation, and hunting and trapping for the wildlife trade (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;&#160;Large-scale clearance of lowland forest throughout the Solomon Islands has had a significant impact on the natural habitat of&#160;<em>E. polychlorosi</em>, forcing it into cultivated lands as a result (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). A steep decline in individuals has also been witnessed over the last 30 years throughout northern Australia, attributable in large part to illegal trapping and trade of the species (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). Both habitat loss and trade have resulted in a notable decline in the species population but not to a sufficient degree to classify&#160;<em>E. polychloros</em>&#160;as threatened&#160;(Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019)."
"<em>E. riedeli</em>&#160;is currently susceptible to both habitat loss through deforestation and local trade. The species is often observed at the edge of the extensive remaining forest suggesting that over the whole of Yamdena and Larat the rate of decline is relatively low (eBird 2019), large areas of Yamdena have limited access to people even today. Rates of deforestation within the range of&#160;<em>E. riedeli</em>&#160;are approximately 8% over three generations (Tracewski&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). The threat posed by trapping and trade is also relatively low. Whilst the species is locally traded, with individuals noted as pets on Yamdena, it does not appear to be exported from the island in large numbers (Bishop and Brickle 1999). The species is CITES II listed (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019)."
"Sumba Eclectus has been intensively trapped for local, national trade, and the international cagebird trade which was believed to be driving a very rapid decline in the species (Marsden 1995, Jones&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995). Targeted conservation action on the island for Yellow-crested Cockatoo&#160;<em>Cacatua sulphurea</em>&#160;brought illegal trapping of that species almost to a halt on the island (Cahill&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Reuleaux 2017), although the moratorium introduced did not apply to Eclectus and trade is thought to have continued in this species at an unknown level. While the estimated deforestation rate on Sumba has been low (estimated from satellite data to be c. 0.1% annually since 2000: Tracewski <em>et al.</em>[2016]), selective logging of large trees is suspected to be having a significant impact, with suitable nesting holes apparently limiting and seemingly restricted to protected areas."
"This species has been heavily traded. Between 1975 and 2014, over 800,000 individuals were exported from Africa (Martin 2018). It is one of the most popular avian pets, since it is regarded as a small, quiet bird that bonds well. In 1981, it was placed in CITES Appendix II alongside all Psittaciformes, and a ""cautious"" export quota for Senegal was set in 1995 (CITES 2006). Following this, and an EU ban on the import of wild-caught birds, reported figures in trade have dropped (Martin <em>et al</em>. 2014). Trade volumes remain high, however, and between 2005 and 2014, over 70,000 individuals were exported from Africa (Martin 2018). The impact of this level of trade on the status of the species has not been determined."
"This species has been strongly threatened by trade in the past, but this pressure has declined significantly since the late 1980s. The species is CITES II listed and trade is now minimal throughout its range; however, it remains susceptible to hunting and trapping (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;<em>Pyrrhura chapmani</em>&#160;is also threatened by significant deforestation throughout its range (Donegan <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;Tree cover loss between 2001 and 2018 within the range of Upper Magdalena Parakeet amounted to 530 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Global Forest Watch 2019)."
"The largest threat currently posed to this species comes from hunting and trapping for the wildlife trade. This has led to a notable decline in the species population but not to a sufficient degree to classify&#160;<em>E. roratus</em>&#160;as threatened (Cottee-Jones&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Collar <em>et al</em>. 2019)."
The species is being  captured in low numbers for the cagebird trade (Sasaoka 2003). No forest was lost within the species's range between 2000 and 2012 (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016); hence deforestation may not be a key threat.
"Habitat destruction through the combined impacts of firewood collection, commercial logging, timber extraction for construction materials and clearance for agriculture together represent the most pertinent threat. The loss and fragmentation of forests is already extensive on Flores, where little semi-evergreen forest below 1,000 m is included within protected areas. These threats are compounded by human population expansion. Even within those areas that receive  protection, illegal logging is continuing as there is virtually no  governmental enforcement of laws. Moist deciduous forest is currently being extensively cleared through land grabbing and establishment of agricultural areas, a factor that is inevitably reducing the range and population of this species. Forest clearance continues in the coastal belt to make way for crops, and illegal logging continues in protected areas.<br/><p></p>"
"Montane humid forest is not under threat, but it is possible that this species has a requirement for other habitats, some of which, notably lowland semi-deciduous forests, have nearly disappeared from the island<strong> </strong>(Ekstrom <em>et al.</em> 2000, 2002)<strong></strong>. Several <em>Charmosyna</em> lorikeets have undergone severe population declines or fluctuations of unknown cause (Forshaw 1989)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. It is possible that introduced disease (such as avian malaria) or more likely mammals (notably rats) may have been a cause of decline (Bregulla 1992; Ekstrom <em>et al.</em> 2000, 2002)<strong></strong>. <p></p>"

"Trapping for trade and land-use changes may be driving a decline in the population, although neither of these threats are regarded as serious for this species at present (C. J.

"The primary threat to this species is deforestation in the   Amazon Basin as land is cleared for cattle ranching and soy production,  facilitated by expansion of the road network, coupled with its susceptibility to trapping (Soares-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2006, Bird <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160;Recent changes to environmental policy in Brazil are seemingly incentivizing farmers to clear more land, and the rate of clear-cut deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon in 2019 was 30% greater than that of 2018, although the area where this species is found has not been affected as badly as other areas (S. Dantas <em>in litt. </em>2020, INPE 2019, Global Forest Watch 2020). The species is assumed to experience some trapping pressure, probably  mainly for domestic trade, as this species is rare in aviculture (del  Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 2016)."
"Trapping for the local cage-bird trade is probably the sole reason for its recent and drastic decline. Trappers estimate that over 17,000 birds were caught in 1981-1994 (a claim verified by dealers), and 1,481 were legally exported in 1981-1984 (Begazo 1996), but no wild-caught specimens were recorded in international trade in 1991-1995<strong> </strong>(Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000). The mortality rate between capture and sale is estimated at 40-100% (Dorst 1957), inevitably raising demand. By 1988, trade was reduced, with just 56 birds recorded in Lima's bird market that year (Begazo 1996). In a study during 2007-2008, 16 individuals were recorded at a market in Chiclayo, the true number traded being much higher since the rate of detection was estimated to be 3% (GastaÃÂ±aga <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011).<strong></strong><p></p>"
"The species has been heavily traded: since 1975 reported exports are greater than 1.3 million individuals; during 1994-2003, over 359,000  wild-caught individuals (combined total of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">erithacus </span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">timneh</span>, the majority <span style=""font-style: italic;"">erithacus</span>) were reportedly exported from range states; and exports in 2005-2014 have been 199,070 individuals (UNEP-WCMC CITES Trade Database 2005; R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016).  Together with <span style=""font-style: italic;"">P. erithacus</span>, it is one of the most popular avian pets in Europe, the United States  and the Middle East due to its longevity and unparalleled ability to  mimic human speech and other sounds. While there has been some domestic demand within range states, most  impacts seem to be due to international trade, probably owing to the  high value of this species<strong></strong>. The Animals Committee of CITES recommended a two-year ban from January 2007 on exports of <em>timneh </em>from  four West African countries (Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and  Guinea),&#160;and since then all of these countries continue to have zero export quotas recommended by CITES. Guinea-Bissau has not issued any export permits since 2000, however these restrictions have been circumvented and exports of wild-sourced birds have continued under the guise of legal trade (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016). For several years Guinea exported significant numbers as Ã¢ÂÂCaptive-bredÃ¢ÂÂ despite there being no commercial-scale breeding facilities in Guinea (CITES 2012). Additionally, multiple shipments have been made from Mali despite the species not naturally occurring there. In late 2015, a shipment of 89 Timneh Parrots that originated in Mali was confiscated in Dakar&#160;(R. Martin&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). In addition, despite there being no legal avenues for commercial exports of wild-sourced birds, some traders continue to advertise exports of recently obtained birds&#160;(R. Martin&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). The import of wild-caught birds into the EU was  prohibited in 2007, leading to a fall in exports of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">P. erithacus </span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">P. timneh</span>, but the number of exportations rose once again in 2008 and 2009 (Anon. 2011), and since then exports have been re-oriented to the Middle East (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016). In 2009, Ghana largely ceased legal exports of <em>P. erithacus</em> in the early 1990s, and around that time trappers and traders from Ghana also moved into other countries. As a result there was additional trapping pressure. Since Ghana ceased commercial exports,&#160;<em>P. timneh&#160;</em>range states (and Mali) have exported 122,868 individuals, with Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea each exporting around 46,000 (not all&#160;<em>P. timneh</em>&#160;as some were&#160;<em>P. erithacus</em>) (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Legal trade as monitored by  CITES may represent only a proportion of the total numbers  captured from the wild. <br/><br/>Habitat loss is undoubtedly having significant impacts throughout the range. Allport (1991) estimated that c.77% of the Upper Guinea EBA forest cover had been lost at the time of that study. Regional forest loss has continued since that date at a high rate (H. Rainey <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2010). In Guinea and Guinea-Bissau, preferred species of nesting trees are also preferred timber species (Clemmons 2002), which is a threat to the stability of breeding populations (Lopes 2015; Lopes <em>et al</em>. 2018b).&#160;An analysis of the factors that predict the distribution and abundance of Timneh Parrots on the BijagÃÂ³s islands of Guinea-Bissau found that the proximity of a permanent human population had a strong negative effect on this species, suggesting human activities are a threat to populations above and beyond the impact they have on forest cover (Lopes <em>et al</em>. 2018a). A recent study predicted that this species could lose approximately 60% of its range by 2050 due to climate change (Freeman <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><p></p>"
"In Central America, original vegetation is converted for agriculture, plantations, cattle-ranching and logging<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Stattersfield <em>et al</em>. 1998; S. Nazeri <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<em> Dipteryx panamensis</em> is selectively logged in Costa Rica (Powell <em>et al</em>. 1995). Pineapple plantations are rapidly expanding and replacing tropical forest habitat in Costa Rica (S. Nazeri <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Annual deforestation rates are high throughout its range (FAO 2001). Deforestation in Panama probably exceeds 30% of its original range<strong> </strong>(G. Angehr <em>in litt</em>. 2005) and in some other countries (e.g., Costa Rica and Ecuador) the historical range was reduced by ~90 % over the past 100 years<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong> (Chassot <em>et al</em>. 2002; O. Jahn <em>in litt</em>. 2004, 2005)<strong></strong>. In its South American range, plans to colonise and develop remoter areas are progressing through infrastructural improvements, particularly the rapid expansion of the road network, which has increased the impact of logging, small-scale agriculture, illegal coca plantations, gold mining, and hunting, which is also affecting some key protected areas (Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund 2001; ÃÂlvarez 2002; BenÃÂ­tez <em>et al</em>. 2002). Large areas of western Ecuador are being purchased, denuded of forest and converted to industrial oil palm plantations (Sharpe 1999). Urbanisation and agriculture have largely extirpated race <em>guayaquilensis</em>, and it is reportedly shot as a crop-pest (Pople <em>et al</em>. 1997; Juniper and Parr 1998)<strong></strong>. There is illegal capture for (mostly internal) trade, food and feathers<strong></strong> (Low 1995; Powell <em>et al</em>. 1995; Sharpe 1999; C. J. Sharpe <em>in litt</em>. 1999; Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000; BenÃÂ­tez <em>et al</em>. 2002)."
"Within the range, up to 47% of natural habitat has already been lost (Renjifo <em>et al</em>. 2016). The main current threat is the expansion of non-native tree plantations, such as those of pine and eucalyptus, along with ongoing clearance of land for livestock farming (C. Olaciregui <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Historically, conversion of forest to marijuana and coca plantations was also a major threat<strong></strong> (L. G. Olarte <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1993; L. M. Renjifo pers. comm. 1993, 2000; J. FjeldsÃÂ¥ verbally 2000; C. Olaciregui <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012), which was compounded by the government spraying herbicides on the sierra<strong></strong> (L. G. Olarte <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>1993; L. M. Renjifo pers. comm. 1993, 2000). Other threats that followed human immigration to the area from the 1950s onwards include logging and burning (Dinerstein <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1995; <strong></strong>Snyder <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2000; Salazar and Strewe undated;<strong> </strong>P. Salaman <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1999, 2020)<strong></strong>. Currently, habitat loss within the range amounts to c.3% over three generations (Global Forest Watch 2021, using Hansen <em>et al. </em>[2013] data and methods disclosed therein; Negret <em>et al</em>. 2021).<br/><br/>The species is known to be hunted in the rÃÂ­o FrÃÂ­o valley, and in San Pedro district individuals in blackberry plantations have been shot. The species has not been found in the local bird trade, but is occasionally kept as a pet in local communities<strong> </strong>(Strewe 2005; Renjifo <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/>&#160; <br/>Climate change may pose an additional risk, as the dry season is intensifying each year (P. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<br/><p></p>"
"It has probably declined since the 19th century as a result of trapping for trade and habitat loss, particularly in the Gran Sabana region of BolÃÂ­var and parts of coastal Guianas<strong></strong> (Wege and Collar 1991). It was internationally traded in small numbers during the 1980s, and this has continued especially in Guyana, where 321 were exported in 2002, and Suriname<strong> </strong>(CITES 2004). Overall, the international pet trade is no longer thought to affect the species (Dickey 2020, O. Ottema <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Some internal trade may still continue, perhaps most frequently for food and pets in the far east of its range (Desenne and Strahl 1991, Wege and Collar 1991, O. Ottema <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Suriname, the species may be killed accidentally by hunters targeting <em>A. amazonica</em>&#160;(O. Ottema <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Large tracts of forests are still pristine in Suriname, but logging and gold mining are increasingly destroying and degrading remaining habitat (O. Ottema <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In the area where the species has been recorded in&#160;ParÃÂ¡, there is significant mining of bauxite on plateaus (de Faria and Gomide Alvim 2013)."
"Habitat loss and fragmentation was previously considered considerable throughout its range, with 90-93% of montane forest lost in Colombia, but less in Peru (Salaman <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1999, P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1999). However, recent evidence suggest that previous forest loss may have been overestimated (Tracewski&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016, Global Forest Watch 2020). The cutting of wax palms for Palm Sunday services is considered a problem in parts of Ecuador, and palms also suffer poor recruitment because cattle browse young trees, with logging in adjacent areas increasing their susceptibility to parasites and disease<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Salaman <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1999).&#160;In the Loja province of Ecuador, cattle ranching and felling of trees for construction products and fuel has previously led to encroachment of habitats (Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000). Road construction is on-going throughout many areas of elfin and cloud forest in Peru and has caused severe habitat loss in areas such as Abra Malaga<strong> </strong>(H. Lloyd <em>in litt.</em> 2007). In Colombia, it was trapped as a maize pest, whilst hunting was also previously persistent<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>(Salaman <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>1999, Quevedo <em>et al</em>. 2006). Many protected areas are affected by the burning and grazing of pÃÂ¡ramo, settlement, clearance for agriculture, logging, narcotics and gold mining (Wege and Long 1995, Salaman <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1999)<strong></strong>. Burning of pasture is additionally known to inhibit plant succession of the primary habitats occupied by this species (Quevedo <em>et al</em>. 2006). At Tapichalaca Reserve in southern Ecuador, occupation of nest boxes by honeybees (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) and predation by snakes and mammals such as <em>Mustela frenata</em>&#160;may pose dangers to both nestlings and adults (Williamson 2011, 2016). Competition between nesting sites by other resident parrot species and predation by large birds of prey such as the Variable hawk (<em>Geranogetus polyosoma</em>) and Black-chested buzzard-eagle (<em>Geranogetus melanoleucus</em>) may also threaten survival of juveniles (Quevedo <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;<p></p>"
"The primary threat is trapping for trade. Birdmarkets in the Balinese and Java regions show that lorikeets remain common (Prihatmoko and Halaouate 2018, M. Halaouate <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Many islands across the Flores Sea (Kalaotoa, Kalao and Tanahjmpea) are also under significant pressure from burning for cashew plantations (J. Eaton <em>in litt</em>. 2020); this is likely to have contributed to the extirpation of the species across this range. Deforestation due to corn planting has also led to the loss of mature trees and flooding across Sumbawa, compounding the affect of trapping on an already rare population (Prihatmoko <em>et al</em>. 2019)."
"The historical decline has been attributed to habitat clearance for agriculture, hunting and trapping (Lima 2007). The main factor currently limiting the population size is believed to be a reduction of food resources, especially licurÃÂ­ (Brandt and Machado 1990,&#160;Lugarini <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Habitat is cleared for the subsistence cultivation of maize, beans and cassava and for large-scale livestock grazing (Lugarini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). LicurÃÂ­ palm-stands formerly covered 250,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;but have been vastly reduced by livestock-grazing.&#160;Vegetation is cleared through burning, which tends to have little control (Lugarini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). A major fire could now eradicate most of the food supply for the Toca Velha-Serra Branca population. The extraction of firewood and timber also pose threats (IBAMA 2006). In 1992-1995, c.20 birds were caught and sold to smugglers from Toca Velha-Serra Branca (Munn 1995), and in 1996 at least 19 individuals were taken (Reynolds 1997). The threat of live-capture for trade, both domestic and international, continues, but has been significantly reduced (Lugarini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, A. Roos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Birds are occasionally persecuted for foraging on maize crops when palm nuts are scarce (Melo Barros <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2006). Hunting for food and wildlife products are potential threats.<p></p>"
The species is threatened by forest loss.
"The species is becoming increasingly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation (Juniper and Parr 1998), with illegal capture for the bird trade also of concern, particularly in Mozambique (Wilkinson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 1998, S. Taylor <em>in litt</em>. 2016)."
"Unsustainable levels of trapping for the cage-bird trade pose the greatest threat. In 1991, an estimated minimum of 6,600 birds (possibly representing a mere quarter of the actual figure) were taken from the wild. Catch quotas for the species were exceeded by up to 18 times in some localities, indicating that trappers were removing in the order of 17% of the population annually. In 2007, the catch quota was 10 pairs, and only for breeding purposes. However, an investigation by ProFauna revealed that  at least 200 White Cockatoo were caught from the wild in North  Halmahera in 2007, far exceeding the quota (ProFauna<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt. </span>2008). Illegal trade continues and is probably grossly underestimated, with many birds being smuggled through Sulawesi and ending up in the bird markets of western Indonesia or being transported to the Philippines (S. Metz <em>in litt. </em>2013). The increased usage in social media and online platforms are additionally providing alternative methods of illegal trade in non-native species in the Philippines (Canlas&#160;<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2017). Nine live birds were for example offered for sale through Philippine social media platforms within just a month of observation (Canlas&#160;<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2017). As both adults and young are taken, exploitation has likely reached unsustainable levels (Rowley and Boesman 2020). Although forest within parts of its range remains relatively intact, exploitation by logging companies has become intensive, and some areas are have been cleared for agriculture and mining.&#160; Vetter (2009) estimated that forest loss within the geographic and elevation range of <em>C. alba</em> was c.20.2% between 1990 and 2003, and projected the loss of c.65.4% of forest in its range over the next three generations. Significant changes in forest cover on Halmahera appear to have driven a concomitant decline in the cockatoo population (F. Lambert <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012).&#160; Habitat and nest-site availability is therefore decreasing, particularly the latter. Furthermore, new logging roads greatly facilitate access for trappers. <br/><p></p>"
"Habitat loss continues apace in the south of Yamdena and this, combined with continued trapping, must be producing a decline. Trapping has particularly been rampant in the past, with villagers hiring catchers to work in tandem across maize fields, averaging collections of c. 30-50 Tanimbar Corellas a day, subsequently exported for prices of US$1-17 (Cahyadin 1993). It may also be persecuted as a crop pest or hunted for food in some areas. The species may be marginally affected by predation (both ground and aerial) (D. Prawiradilaga <em>in litt</em>&#160;2020).&#160;<p></p>"
"Its<strong> </strong>precipitous decline is almost entirely attributable to unsustainable exploitation for internal and international trade. Although exports effectively became illegal in 1994, poor enforcement and monitoring enabled trapping to continue (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2001). Illegal trapping continued in many area including Rawa Aopa Watumohai National Park, Buton and Kadatua islands (Anon. 2012), where populations are now either much-depleted or extirpated entirely (A. Reuleaux <em>in litt</em>. 2021; T. Martin <em>in litt</em>. 2021). Large-scale logging and conversion of forest to agriculture across its range has exacerbated the decline and this is set to continue. The current and future rate of forest cover loss in the current occupied and probably occupied range (based on the estimated mean annual rate over the most recent five years, per Global Forest Watch 2021) is projected to be 16.1% over three generations. Although this species is adaptable to land conversion, it still requires large trees with substantial hollows for breeding, thus is affected detrimentally by the removal of old growth forest. On the Flores Sea islands, agricultural conversion is considered the principal threat, while hunting for food, not the pet trade, was identified as a likely threat (Bashari and Arndt 2016). Juvenile Komodo Dragons <em>Varanus komodensis</em>&#160;pose a threat to nestlings on Komodo (Nandika and Agustina 2012). Competition for cavity nest sites with other parrots and owls in large trees (those targeted by logging activities) leads to low productivity in <em>C. citrinocristata</em>&#160;(Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005) and may affect this species given its similar ecology. On the smaller islands of Roti, Alor and Pantar, capacity for the enforcement of hunting and trading regulations is low (F. Verbelen<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt. </span>2012).<p></p>"
"It was the most commonly traded wild bird in the world in 1987 and was the most popular wild-caught parrot imported into the then European Economic Community, accounting for c.80% of the Psittacine exports from Tanzania<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(RSPB 1991)<strong></strong>. Legal trapping for export has now been halted, but the population is still much lower than it was, and trade could re-start; although this bird is now being bred in captivity for the pet trade (Moyer 1995; A. Mathur <em>in litt</em>. 2009)<strong></strong>. Exports of this species from the African continental mainland between 2005 and 2014 numbered roughly 800 individuals (Martin 2018). Over 20,000 individuals were imported into Singapore between 2005 and 2016 (Aloysius <em>et al.</em> 2019). The species has hybridised with Yellow-collared Lovebird <em>A. personata</em> in the wild, and although it was originally thought not to hybridise within its natural range (there is range overlap but <em>A. fischeri</em> appeared to be a non-breeding visitor to <em>A. personata</em> habitat [<strong></strong>Morton and Bhatia 1992; N. Baker <em>in litt</em>. 1999<strong></strong>]<strong></strong>), this is no longer considered the case. There is possible evidence of hybridisation within its range, presumed as a result of release/escape from captivity (R. Wirth <em>in litt. </em>2015); with hybrids recorded in Serengeti NP - within the range of <em>A. fischeri</em> but well away from its contact zone with <em>A. personatus</em> (Kolber 2016). It remains unclear whether the destruction of woodland, that had previously separated the two species, has led to the two taxa encountering each other more often and leading to hybridisation (R. Wirth <em>in litt.</em> 2015).<br/><p></p>"
"Population declines are attributable to habitat loss, trapping for the cage-bird trade, and the impact of invasive species, mainly via nest predation (Juniper and Parr 1998; BirdLife Jamaica Parrot Project <em>in litt.</em> 1998, 2000; Poole and Shepherd 2017; Gibson 2020)<strong></strong>. <br/>The main driver of ongoing population reductions is nest predation by  invasive species, particularly rats and mongoose (Gibson 2020). Hybridisation with escaped non-native <em>Amazona </em>parrots presents a further threat (S. Koenig <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>.<br/>Nest trees are lost owing to illegal timber extraction in bauxite mining areas (S. Koenig <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Logging has however declined significantly throughout the  species's range in recent years (L. Gibson&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020), currently totaling 6-7% over three generations (Global Forest  Watch 2021). Population declines are exacerbated by the contraction of suitable  habitat and range size caused by increased drought frequency due to climate change (L. Gibson&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>A major cause of nest failure is poaching for use as a cage-bird, but the level of trapping appears to have declined in recent years (L. Gibson <em>in litt</em>. 2020)<strong></strong>. The cutting of trees to trap nestlings may further reduce available nest-sites significantly (Juniper and Parr 1998; BirdLife Jamaica Parrot Project <em>in litt.</em> 1998, 2000)<strong></strong>."
"It is trapped for the domestic, and formerly at least, international cage bird trade. Nest trees are often pushed over or nest cavities enlarged to extract chicks, rendering them useless for future breeding attempts.  The poaching pressure is so high that most nests in Cuba are raided every year and nestling recruitment is seriously reduced (M. CaÃÂ±izares <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Housing development threatens the non-breeding habitat of the Abaco population while housing and infrastructure development significantly threatens both foraging and nesting habitat in the Cayman Islands (Haakonsson <em>et al</em>. 2017). Forest loss throughout the species's range is currently estimated at ~7% across three generations (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;Hurricanes also pose a threat (Marsden 2013).<p></p>"
"Agricultural conversion and charcoal production have destroyed most suitable habitat and forest loss within the species's range is currently estimated at ~10% across three generations (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is also persecuted as a crop-pest, hunted for food and trapped for the local and formerly at least, international cage-bird trade (Juniper and Parr 1998)<strong></strong>. Trapping of adults and robbing nests for chicks to supply the local pet trade is a particular concern because in some areas most families own a parrot, and these only live a few years before they have to be replaced (G. Woolmer <em>in litt. </em>2005, T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012, S. Marsden <em>in litt</em>. 2017)<strong></strong>. Moreover, nest-robbing activities frequently result in destruction of the nest cavity or nest tree, further exacerbating loss of nesting habitat to other causes (T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012).   <p></p>"
"Suitable forested habitat for this species has almost entirely been lost. Hunting for food, pest control and the cage-bird trade have had crippling effects in the past (T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). The principal threats are now competition for nest-sites, loss of young to parasitic botflies, predation and natural disasters such as hurricanes (Raffaele <em>et al.</em> 1998; Arendt 2000)<strong></strong>. Red-tailed Hawks <em>Buteo jamaicensis</em> predate parrots and hamper releases of captive-bred individuals. Predator-aversion training prior to release has improved the survival of captive-reared birds after release into the wild (White <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2005)<strong></strong>; nevertheless raptor predation claimed 21% of all released individuals between 2000 and 2002 and is considered to have removed one of the two remaining individuals from the now absent El Yunque National Park population (M. Lopez-Flores&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2019). The species formerly suffered from competition for nesting cavities with Pearly-eyed Thrasher <em>Margarops fuscatus</em>, but this has been significantly reduced by specially designed artificial nesting cavities (T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Predation by alien invasive mammals is also having a serious impact upon productivity, with six fledglings taken by Small Indian Mongooses <em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em> and one nest failure from Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> during 2000-2003 (Engeman <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2006); the Luquillo Forest of El Yunque has the amongst the highest Black Rat densities of any site studied globally (J. Thompson <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Although predation events have not been documented, feral cats <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Felis catus, which </span>are well-documented around the world as devastating bird predators, are also common in parrot habitat in El Yunque National Forest, and represent another threat from an invasive mammal. Parrots regularly disappear without identification of a cause, while cats and mongooses are capable of inflicting unidentifiable losses (R. M. Engeman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). The Puerto Rican Boa comprises an additional potential nest predator (J. Thompson <em>in litt</em>. 2019). It has been suggested that hurricanes are the most serious limiting factor preventing population recovery, and climate change may cause the frequency of hurricane events to increase<strong></strong>. Such devastating hurricane impacts are apparent in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria with the wild population of <em>Amazona vittata</em>&#160;no longer present in El Yunque (M. Lopez-Flores&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2019). Furthermore, rainfall hampers the recovery programme, as chicks that fledge either during or before a major rainfall event have a much higher mortality rate than chicks that fledge during drier periods (Breining 2009)<strong></strong>.<p></p>"
"The decline in this species prior to the 1960s is thought to have been driven mainly by predation by introduced rats and hunting by settlers and farmers (Rocamora and Laboudallon  2013). Other causes of increased mortality have included capture for pets and trade and incidental trapping when other species, namely fruit bats, are targeted. The most serious current threats to the species include ongoing nest predation from rats and cats, poaching of its main nesting tree (coco de mer), and habitat destruction caused by  fires, with potential threats including persecution, netting  of bat species and low genetic diversity (Jackson <em>et al.</em> 2016). Forest fires may represent the most serious threat to the species, with records since the early 1980s showing that approximately every 10 years a large forest fire occurs (Seychelles Islands Foundation <em>in litt</em>. 2014). The availability of nesting cavities may be a limiting factor in very active breeding years, with some females occupying sub-optimal cavities. The poaching of coco de mer nuts could reduce the area of palm forest over the long term, although recent anti-poaching measures appear to be successful.&#160;Rose-ringed Parakeets <em>Alexandrinus krameri, </em>which once posed a major threat, have been entirely eradicated from the Seychelles by the Seychelles Islands Foundation. <em>A. krameri </em>carried diseases such as Beak and Feather Disease Virus, which was a serious threat for <em>C. barklyi </em>(Fogell <em>et al.</em> 2018). The impacts of introduced species through nest predation and competition for nest-sites may not yet be serious enough to limit the population; however, mynahs are increasing on Praslin (Dueker 2018). Invasive yellow crazy ants are an emerging threat, with numbers having increased substantially in Praslin's palm forest habitat from 2015-2018. The ants have caused at least two <em>C. barklyi</em> nest failures. Yellow crazy ants are now being controlled with a baiting programme across the VallÃÂ©e de Mai and other parts of Praslin's remaining palm forest (N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2020). Predation of fledglings by cats and dogs is probably limited and post-fledging mortality is not currently a major concern as most fledglings are seen again in the year after they fledge (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data). Another risk factor for the species is the substantial and so-far unexplained fluctuations in its breeding activity, with minimal or no breeding occurring approximately every four breeding seasons (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data)."
"Capture for domestic and international trade is the major threat to wild populations. The species is highly valued in trade (CantÃÂº&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007) and was the most captured Amazon parrot species in the early 1980Ã¢ÂÂs (IÃÂ±igo-Elias and Ramos 1991). From 1998-2008, 860 <em>Amazona finschi</em>&#160;were legally captured (J. C. CantÃÂº <em>in litt</em>. 2017). Illegal trade is intensive and widespread, and&#160;<em>Amazona finschi</em>&#160;is one of the most frequently confiscated Mexican parrots (K. Renton&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>.&#160;It was the sixth most confiscated parrot in Mexico from 1995-2005 and the third most confiscated Mexican parrot in the USA from 1992-2005 (CantÃÂº <em>et al</em>. 2007). During 1981-2001, 4,061 individuals were recorded as traded internationally, of which 79% were exported directly from Mexico and 64% were taken from the wild (CITES 2004a)<strong></strong>.&#160;Captive breeding of parrots was promoted by Mexican environmental authorities to help in conservation but only 154<em> A. finschiÃ¢ÂÂs</em> were bred from 2002-2008 and it didnÃ¢ÂÂt help stop illegal trade (CantÃÂº in press 2020). It remains one of the top five most-captured Mexican parrot species, with an estimated 5,000 individuals/year captured illegally in Mexico (CantÃÂº&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007). It is one of the most illegally sold parrot species on the internet (J. C. CantÃÂº, per. obs.). Adults and juveniles are easily netted in large numbers because of their habit of congregating at communal roost sites late in the afternoon (Renton 2005, K. Renton&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>. Chicks are commonly poached from nests (K. Renton&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>. During interviews with local people throughout the species's range, 75% reported poaching in their area (K. Renton&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>. In addition, this species is reported to require semi-deciduous forest with tall, mature trees for nesting, and may not adapt to nesting in modified areas (see Monterrubio-Rico&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009, Marin-Togo&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Habitat loss and degradation, mostly for conversion to both small-holder and large-scale cultivation and pasture are serious threats (K. Renton<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2007, A. Salinas<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2007, Ortega-RodrÃÂ­guez and Monterrubio-Rico 2008). Semi-deciduous forest along the Pacific coast is being lost at a greater rate than any other forest type in Mexico (Masera&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996, K. Renton&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>, resulting in the destruction of nest sites and reduction in the extent of this crucial breeding habitat (Renton 2005)<strong></strong>. In MichoacÃÂ¡n, the more easily accessible potential nesting areas, such as plains or rolling hills, have now been converted to extensive cattle ranching or agriculture (Ortega-RodrÃÂ­guez and Monterrubio-Rico 2008). Large development projects, such as dams, have also resulted in loss of breeding habitat for the species (K. Renton<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Semi-deciduous forest now covers only 3,847 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;or 6.6% of the species's current known distribution (Marin-Togo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Despite the various pressures on habitats, Marin-Togo <em>et al</em>. (2012) determined that <em>Amazona finshi</em>&#160;has disappeared from more than 70% of its estimated former range and that primary habitat comprises more than half the area of absence for this species (60.7%), which reinforces the view that trapping pressure is the predominant threat to the species. Nevertheless,&#160;the endemic <em>Amazona finschi</em> faces new threats associated with global change through increased habitat loss and climate change. The increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes making landfall along the Pacific coast has indirect cascading effects on parrot reproduction through the loss of nest-sites and reduction in food resources (Renton <em>et al</em>. 2018). While reproductive output of <em>Amazona finschi</em> recovered following landfall by a minor hurricane (Renton <em>et al</em>. 2018), landfall by the major Hurricane Patricia in 2015 resulted in the loss of 61.5% of nest-sites, and reduced reproductive output by nesting parrots, among the lowest recorded for the species, which has yet to recover 4 years after hurricane landfall (K. Renton unpubl. data).<p></p>"
"The human population of St Lucia is growing at a considerable rate, increasing pressure on the forest and resulting in habitat loss (Copsey 1995)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Selective logging of mature trees may significantly reduce breeding sites (Juniper and Parr 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and hurricanes, hunting and trade pose further threats. There&#160;have been recent efforts to lift the moratorium on hunting within forest reserves, which would seriously threaten this species (J.&#160;D.&#160;Gilardi <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>"
"Habitat loss has been extensive, with 77.4% of primary habitat within the species's potential historical distribution and 80% of the Tamaulipas lowlands cleared for agriculture and pasture, and increasing settlement along the Western Highway in Belize (Somerville 1997, Monterrubio <em>et al. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. Forest loss throughout the species's full range remains extreme, totaling ~22.5% across three generations (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Belize, where much of the suitable habitat lies outside the national protected area system, the regions occupied by the species remain under heavy pressure from development and illegal fires (B. Miller <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Palm savannahs at the only known breeding site in Guatemala are used for non-intensive cattle-grazing (Eisermann 2003), which continues to be a threat here (Fundary <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). <br/><br/>Many thousands of individuals of this species are illegally exported from Mexico and some from Belize each year, and it is popular in domestic markets (Low 1995,&#160;Miller and Miller 1997, Somerville 1997). Illegal domestic traffic is intense in Mexico and may account for 38% of the species's recent distributional loss (T. Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al. in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. In the Mexican states of Michoacan, Guerrero and Oaxaca, it is mainly nestlings that are taken for the pet trade (T. Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al. in litt. </em>2007), with 76% of 13 active nests monitored in 2012 being poached (T. Monterrubio-Rico <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Guatemala, it is reported that local military authorities are complicit in the illegal trade of this species, and nest poachers are reported to frequent the species's nesting site (Eisermann 2003, K. Eisermann <em>in litt</em>. 2007). In addition, hunting for food by local fishermen has been reported from Guatemala (Eisermann 2003, K. Eisermann <em>in litt</em>. 2007). In Belize, it is hunted and persecuted for damaging crops (S. N. G. Howell <em>in litt</em>. 1998)<strong></strong> and is still a victim of the illicit pet trade, capture for which involves the cutting down of nesting trees (B. Miller <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Its range around coastal MichoacÃÂ¡n is estimated to have declined by 1,507 km<sup>2</sup>, of which 576 km<sup>2</sup> can not be attributed to habitat loss and thus may be due to poaching for trade (Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al.</em> 2007). <br/><br/>Additional threats to isolated populations of the species may occur from the increased impact of high intensity hurricanes. In October 2018, the category 3 Hurricane Willa passed directly over the Islas Marias on the Pacific coast of Nayarit, which maintains the island endemic subspecies of <em>Amazona oratrix tresmariae</em>. It is unknown how this endemic population may have been affected by the hurricane impact.<p></p>"
"This species is hunted and trapped for food, pets and international  trade, however population declines in this species are largely attributable to deforestation (Juniper and Parr 1998, Forshaw 2006, Wenner <em>et al</em>. 2012, De Labra-HernÃÂ¡ndez and Renton 2017). <em>Amazona guatemalae</em>&#160;has now been extirpated from a significant proportion of its original range and is now present in just ~53-55% of its original distribution (RÃÂ­os-MuÃÂ±oz and Navarro-SigÃÂ¼enza 2009, Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al</em>. 2016). Such declines are the result of dramatic forest conversion as this species is highly dependent on the primary, old-growth tropical forest of Mesoamerica (De Labra-HernÃÂ¡ndez and Renton 2016), evidenced by densities of 18.9 parrots/kmÃÂ² in evergreen forest and 35.9 parrots/kmÃÂ² in riparian forest, compared with just 3.4 parrots/kmÃÂ² in secondary forest (De Labra-HernÃÂ¡ndez and Renton 2017)."
"Hunting for food, trapping for the cage-bird trade and habitat loss were the principal causes of this species's decline. Deforestation has been the result of forestry activities, the expansion of banana cultivation, charcoal production, the loss of nesting-trees felled by trappers seeking young birds for trade, and natural events such as hurricanes and volcanic eruptions (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. The introduced nine-banded armadillo <em>Dasypus novemcinctus </em>undermines large trees causing them to topple, reducing the number of suitable nest trees (Culzac-Wilson 2005)<strong></strong>. A cross-country road is planned, funded by the Taiwanese government, which would destroy large areas of suitable habitat and increase deforestation rates (Culzac-Wilson <em>et al. </em>2003)<strong></strong>.  The genetic isolation of the separate subpopulations may present further cause for concern. <p></p>"
"Capture for the wild-bird trade represents a serious threat with an estimated 8,000 individuals captured illegally per year (CantÃÂº <em>et al</em>. 2007). The species's range falls within one of the main routes for illegal parrot trade in Mexico and heavy exploitation of the species is thought to be an important factor in its apparent absence from areas of suitable habitat (MarÃÂ­n-Togo <em>et al</em>. 2012)."
"The species is threatened by habitat loss for conversion to agricultural areas (Forshaw 2006, Collar <em>et al.</em> 2020). Tree cover loss throughout this species's range is currently estimated at ~3% across three generations (Global Forest Watch 2021, using Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2013] data and methods disclosed therein), although Cerro Hoyo National Park appears largely intact. It is suspected that there may be some domestic trade (S. Bruslund <em>in litt</em>. 2022), though the impact on the population size is unknown (Collar <em>et al.</em> 2020)."
"Intensive grazing and agricultural conversion have destroyed and degraded forest (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 1996, Macias Caballero 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Annual fires burn large areas (in 1998, 20 km<sup>2</sup> of foraging habitat were lost [GÃÂ³mez-Garza and Garza-TobÃÂ³n 1998]<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and 20 km<sup>2</sup> of pine forest, including 90% of El Taray Sanctuary, were lost to two wildfires in 2005-2006 [ValdÃÂ©s-PeÃÂ±a and Ortiz Maciel 2007, R. ValdÃÂ©s-PeÃÂ±a <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007, 2010<strong><sup></sup></strong>]), which regenerate as dense (and unsuitable) <span style=""font-style: italic;"">chaparral </span>vegetation (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 1996, Macias Caballero 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Data suggest that between 1999 and 2008 more than 15,400 ha of pine forest in the species's breeding range were destroyed by wildfires (S. G. Ortiz-Maciel <em>et al</em>.<em> in litt</em>. 2010)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Droughts fuel fires and dry up natural water sources (in 1994, at least 50 birds drowned whilst attempting to drink from a cement-walled water tank [Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000]<strong><sup></sup></strong>). Additionally, the species is affected by low pinion production, and pressure from local people who collect pinions as an alternative income source (R. ValdÃÂ©s-PeÃÂ±a <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007, 2010)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Forest is also cleared for timber extraction (ValdÃÂ©s-PeÃÂ±a and Ortiz Maciel 2007) and forest loss throughout the species's range is currently estimated at ~2.5% across three generations (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016). Climate change may also affect this species, as with a shift towards a drier environment may have a negative effect on breeding performance (Ortiz-Maciel <em>et al. </em>2014), and could lead to the complete disappearance of this species's currently occupied habitat by 2090 (Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al. </em>2015). The species is affected by some trapping and shooting (Ortiz-Maciel <em>et al.</em> 2006, ValdÃÂ©s-PeÃÂ±a and Ortiz Maciel 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and may experience years of low breeding success (Ortiz-Maciel <em>et al.</em> 2006, 2014)<strong><sup></sup></strong> or even zero recruitment (R. ValdÃÂ©s-PeÃÂ±a <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007, 2010)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>"
"Despite legal protection, small-scale poaching for the local pet trade and hunting of parakeets for both food and as crop pests continues. Enforcement is weak and many members of the public remain uninformed that killing a bird with a catapult (slingshot) is defined as ""hunting"" (i.e., ""hunting"" is typically viewed as killing gamebirds with a shotgun), and, consequently, illegal. Environmental education campaigns focus on the two larger, more charismatic endemic <em>Amazona </em>parrots (C. Levy and S. Koenig<em> in litt.</em> 2014). <br/>Habitat loss and fragmentation are perhaps the greatest on-going threats, particularly the conversion of coastal habitats for hotel, residential and commercial development, although deforestation rates are not high (estimated at ~2.75% across three generations [Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016]). Foraging behaviour is poorly-known, and use of the landscape in search of seasonally-available food resources is not understood (C. Levy and S. Koenig<em> in litt.</em> 2014).<br/>As a frugivore, the species is susceptible to starvation following extreme weather events, such as hurricanes. Compounding the short-term loss of food from the forest canopy, hungry parakeets have been observed feeding on fruits blown to the ground during a hurricane; this behaviour may render them more vulnerable to predation by invasive alien predators, such as mongoose (<em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>) and cats (<em>Felis catus</em>), or to persecution by humans. Additionally, temporary loss of natural food resources may make them more prone to attack any crops which escaped the ravages of strong winds and rain; this also will lead to persecution by farmers. <br/>The number of suitable termite nests may be a limiting factor of parakeet reproductive performance (C. Levy and S. Koenig<em> in litt.</em> 2014), while the importation and escape into the wild of alien psittacines is a further potential threat. Invasive alien psittacines pose threats via the introduction of harmful pathogens (e.g. Psittacine Circovirus / Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease) and parasites, competition for food resources, and, depending upon the species, may compete for nesting substrates (C. Levy and S. Koenig<em> in litt.</em> 2014). At least one alien species of parakeet (<em>Psittacula krameri</em>) has become established in Jamaica, occurring in Kingston/St. Andrew, where it is expanding in number (C. Levy and S. Koenig<em> in litt.</em> 2014)."
"Human impacts on indigenous forests, most of which have little visible protection, may affect nest site and food availability. There is a long history of logging by settlers, with selective logging taking place more recently and continued illegal logging in some areas (Downs 2015). Removal of adults from the wild for illegal trade is a potential threat; the number of birds involved is uncertain but it does not currently appear to be having a population-level impact. There is a potential risk that recognition as a species, and CITES listing, could increase international demand for trade in the species in the future (Collar and Fishpool, 2017). An increasing prevalence of Psittacine Beak-and-Feather disease has been predicted, but the likely impact is uncertain (Downs 2015). Climate change may lead to increased drought within the range and have negative impact on recruitment and fruiting of indigenous forests."
"Habitat loss and especially domestic trade are the chief threats, even within reserves (Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000). In 1991-1995, 96 wild-caught specimens were found in international trade, with Bolivia and Mexico possibly the most significant exporters<strong> </strong>(Chebez 1994,<strong> </strong>D. Brightsmith <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. In Mexico, it is still one of the most sought-after species in the illegal cagebird trade; in 1995-2005, it was the fifth most seized Mexican Psittacine species by the country's Environmental Enforcement Agency, becoming the fourth most seized Psittacine species in 2007-2010 (J. C. CantÃÂº <em>in litt</em>. 2010). In many areas it nests in relatively inaccessible cavities on cliff walls, which provides some protection against the pressures of nest poaching (E. R. RodrÃÂ­guez-RuÃÂ­z and A. Banda&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). However, nest poaching is a severe threat in Jalisco and Nayarit where the species nests in tree cavities (C. Bonilla <em>in litt. </em>2007, K. Renton <em>in litt. </em>2007).&#160;Furthermore, the dependence on nest-cavities in tall emergent trees means there is limited availability of suitable nest sites for Military Macaws (de la Parra-MartÃÂ­nez <em>et al</em>. 2015), and these are vulnerable to forestry practices that extract large valuable-wood trees (K. Renton <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Jalisco, Mexico, macaws were not found in deforested areas, even where abundant <em>Hura polyandra</em> (an important food source) were left as shade for cattle<strong> </strong>(Renton 2004). GARP analysis estimates that the species has suffered 23% habitat loss within its range in Mexico<strong> </strong>(RÃÂ­os MuÃÂ±oz 2002) and currently, forest loss throughout the species's full range is estimated at ~13% per three generations (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;As the species feeds on agricultural land (crops include corn, walnuts and olives) it may also be threatened by persecution (E. R. RodrÃÂ­guez-RuÃÂ­z and A. Banda&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). Gold mining operations in Mexico, particularly in the Balsas Region, also pose a threat owing to the associated deforestation and pollution (A. Siguenza and L. Vasquez Reyes&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). In Jaumave, Tamaulipas, Mexican gray squirrels (<em>Sciurus aureogaster</em>) may compete for food with the species&#160;(E R. RodrÃÂ­guez-RuÃÂ­z and A. Banda&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;One sub-population in the Cauca valley, Colombia, numbering fewer than 50 mature individuals, may shortly be lost as a dam is expected to flood the sole nesting cliff (FundaciÃÂ³n ProAves 2011).&#160;<p></p>"
"Habitat loss and persecution as a crop-pest are the greatest threats to this species. It is exploited for local and international trade, but only 12 wild-caught individuals were reported in international trade in 1991-1995 (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>"
"Habitat loss at lower elevations has been mainly caused by clearance for agriculture (Collar 1997). Although replanting with fruit crops has benefited the species (Reillo and Durand 2008), frugivory by the parrots has sparked conflict with local farmers (Douglas 2011). Hurricane-related damage has also been important: hurricane Maria has at least temporarily reversed recent population increases. Hunting and illegal trade are now low-level threats, but illegal wildlife trade across the Caribbean is a constant concern and there is increasing pressure from illegal wildlife trade centered in Europe (P. R. Reillo <em>in litt.</em> 2016, Reillo 2019). In 2018, ten individuals rehabilitated for release post-Maria were exported to a private breeding facility in Germany without coordination with Dominica's Forestry, Wildlife and Parks Division or parrot programme managers (Reillo 2019). <br/><p></p>"
"The species is threatened by habitat loss, forest degradation and by direct exploitation. Currently, the most severe among these threats is hurricane damage, which not only leads to vast destruction of habitat, but also to direct mortality. Hurricane Maria destroyed about 30% of the forest cover on Dominica and defoliated a large proportion of the remaining trees (Forestry and Agriculture Department <em>per</em> Palmer <em>et al.</em> 2018). In the aftermath of Maria, most individuals were observed foraging in lowland areas outside of their range (S. Durand <em>per </em>C. Palmer <em>in litt.</em> 2019), indicating that, at the time of the sightings, montane forests had not sufficiently recovered from the impacts of the hurricane and by now only offer a low quality habitat (C. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Hurricanes frequently occur in the Caribbean and therefore&#160;are a  natural feature of the species's habitat, which may cause the species to  undergo cyclical fluctuations (C. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2019; Reillo 2019).  However, as the frequency of particularly intense hurricanes in the  Caribbean is projected to increase as a consequence of climate change  (Bender <em>et al</em>. 2010; Knutson <em>et al.</em> 2010), there is an increased likelihood that severe storms may hit Dominica before the population has a chance to recover (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2019; C. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2019).<br/>&#160; <br/>Apart from hurricane-related damage, forested habitat is also lost for conversion to agriculture (Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000). Deforestation may increase competition for nest-sites with the more numerous Red-necked Amazon <em>Amazona arausiaca</em>, as the two species  come increasingly into contact (Dominica Ministry of Agriculture and the  Environment <em>in litt.</em> 2000; Wiley <em>et al</em>. 2004)<strong></strong>.<br/>&#160; <br/>Imperial Amazon is further threatened by trapping. Opportunistic hunting for food and occasional trapping for the cage-bird trade contributed to the species's decline up until the 1990s (P. R. Reillo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Local trade has been considerably reduced, if not eliminated, as a result of a successful education programme, but foreign bird-collectors still pose a threat (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000, Reillo 2019)<strong></strong>. Two captive individuals housed at a facility run by Dominica's Forestry, Wildlife and Parks Division, one of which was rescued after Hurricane Maria, were exported to a private breeding facility in Germany without coordination with the Forestry, Wildlife and Parks Division or parrot programme managers (Cox and Oltermann 2018; Palmer <em>et al.</em> 2018; Reillo 2019). While issues relating to the ex-situ conservation of this species are  complex and often controversial (Reillo <em>et al</em>. 2011; Reillo 2019), the overall number of individuals held in captivity is extremely low (Reillo <em>et al</em>. 2011; C. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2019; Reillo 2019). The species's life-history characteristics and ecology render <em>ex situ</em> captive breeding an unjustified, ineffective recovery tool, whereas comprehensive <em>in situ</em> conservation efforts have proven successful (Wiley <em>et al</em>. 2004; Reillo and Durand 2008; Reillo <em>et al</em>. 2011; Reillo 2019). The potential extirpation of the species in the wild may result in the functional extinction of  the species (C. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2019). However, Dominica's Forestry, Wildlife and Parks Division has successfully maintained the Parrot Conservation and Research Center (PCRC), a rehabilitation facility for releasable parrots with a long-term holding capacity for non-releasable birds.<p></p>"
"Loss of habitat within the historic range has dramatically reduced and fragmented the area available to this species (Joseph and Stockwell 2002; Botero-Delgadillo and PÃÂ¡ez 2011; ProAves <em>in litt. </em>2011). Original habitat has mainly been converted for agriculture and cattle pastures (Botero-Delgadillo and PÃÂ¡ez 2011). Further potential threats include trapping for the cage-bird trade, hunting for food as well as pollution with agrochemicals (Botero-Delgadillo and PÃÂ¡ez 2011)."
"Habitat loss is the greatest threat to the species, with an estimated 70% of the species original habitat having been lost to cattle ranching and other clearance (Botero-Delgadillo <em>et al</em>. 2012a). The majority of the speciesÃ¢ÂÂs distribution is highly fragmented and the landscape is dominated by a complex matrix of agricultural land, cattle pastures, secondary growth and small patches of forest (Botero-Delgadillo et al. 2012a,b). The Venezuelan side of the Sierra de PerijÃÂ¡ is being rapidly colonised, particularly by Colombian farmers  (Sharpe 2015; C. J. Sharpe<em> in litt</em>. 2015). There are concerns that this may disrupt movement and dispersal, due to the species being unwilling to cross large-extensions of open habitats (Botero-Delgadillo <em>et al.</em> 2013). Habitat destruction in the PerijÃÂ¡ Mountains has also been driven by the illicit drug trade and associated enforcement operations, and conservation activities for this species are considered likely to be significantly constrained throughout much of the range (FjeldsÃÂ¥ <em>et al. </em>2005). The species has also been recorded in the wild bird trade, and local people within the species's range are said to value the species as a pet (Tovar-MartÃÂ­nez 2010; Botero-Delgadillo and PÃÂ¡ez 2011; Botero-Delgadillo<em> et al.</em> 2012a)."
"Past and continuing forest destruction and fragmentation through logging, conversion to agriculture, human settlement and development of the road network have been extensive<strong></strong> (Salaman 2000), especially below 2,500 m on the west slope (Stattersfield <em>et al</em>. 1998). Up to 75% of its original habitat is estimated to have been lost (Botero-Delgadillo<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span><em>et al. </em>2012, Renjifo <em>et al</em>. 2014). The greatest current threats to forest in the Eastern Cordillera are cattle grazing and burning for agriculture<strong> </strong>(CortÃÂ©s-Herrera<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span><em>et al. </em>2007). Logging is fairly widespread and may have caused local extirpations on the western slope, although some large areas of intact habitat persist on the eastern slope (<strong></strong>Stiles 1992, P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 1999, Renjifo <em>et al</em>. 2014, E. Botero-Delgadillo <em>in litt</em>. 2020)<strong></strong>. Low levels of selective logging affect GuanentÃÂ¡-Alto RÃÂ­o Fonce Fauna and Flora Sanctuary. It is persecuted by local farmers as a crop-pest, a problem which may intensify as further forest is cleared for agriculture. Locally, it is kept as a pet, but it is unaffected by international trade. Nest site availability is considered the main population limiting factor<strong> </strong>(Anon. 2005). <p></p>"
"Habitat loss and in particular trapping for the cage-bird trade explain the species's current rarity (A. Kirkconnell <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. In the past, it was persecuted as a crop-pest (M. CaÃÂ±izares <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Another significant threat is loss of nesting-trees (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000) as a result of poaching activity and hurricane damage (such as caused in Zapata by Hurricane Lilli in 1996) (A. Mitchell <em>in litt.</em> 1998, M. CaÃÂ±izares <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. Pressure for the illegal export of this species, mainly to the USA and Europe, has increased considerably in recent years (M. CaÃÂ±izares <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016, 2020).<p></p>"
"The species is threatened by habitat loss and degradation, driven primarily by the expansion of agriculture, and capture for local and international trade (Juniper and Parr 1998; Anon. 2008). Deforestation has been a prevalent threat in all range states (Grijalva 2008). For example, mangrove forests in the Gulf of Fonseca region are being cleared for the development of aquaculture and extraction of firewood and timber (Grijalva 2008). In Honduras, the species has been recorded as being c.93% less common in modified habitats, such as cultivation, compared to broadleaved forest (Wiedenfeld 1993). The conversion of areas to sugar cane or rice production is also threatening its habitat, particularly in Nicaragua (C. Dahlin and T. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Mexico, less than 30% of the original cover of primary habitat remains within the species's range (J. C. CantÃÂº <em>in litt</em>. 2021).<br/>The species is considered one of the most sought-after psittacines in the Central American pet trade<em></em>, owing to its vocal capabilities (Wiedenfeld 1993; R. Bjork <em>in litt</em>. 2011; J. Gilardi <em>in litt</em>. 2011; C. Muccio <em>in litt</em>. 2021). During the 1990s, close to 100% of known nests in southern Guatemala were subject to poaching; since 2004, 74 individuals have been seized from illegal trade (L. Joyner <em>in litt</em>. 2011; C. Muccio <em>in litt</em>. 2021). In El Salvador, the species also suffers heavy nest-poaching (R. Bjork <em>in litt</em>. 2011). At least 100 individuals are legally kept as pets in the country, while 57 individuals were confiscated from illegal trade between 2014 and 2019 (N. Herrera <em>in litt</em>. 2021). It has been reported that each year c.5,000 young <em>A. auropalliata</em> are smuggled out of the La Mosquitia region, Honduras (<em>per</em> O. Andino <em>in litt</em>. 2011), although this has not been verified. Such numbers would not be unrealistic given that on average, 8,388 birds were recorded in export from Honduras each year in the period 1987-1989 (Wiedenfeld 1993). Not only adults and chicks, but also eggs are sought after by traffickers (L. Joyner<em> in litt</em>. 2021). An increase in seizure levels in Mexico suggests that trapping pressure is currently increasing (J. C. CantÃÂº <em>in litt</em>. 2021). The numbers recorded in export from Nicaragua appeared to be decreasing in the past (Lezama <em>et al</em>. 2004); however, nest poaching is still high (J. A. DÃÂ­az Luque <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011; M. Lezama <em>in litt</em>. 2011), and thought to affect over 50% of nests in Rivas department (M. Lezama <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Recent market surveys however show that trade has been increasing again since 2016 in Managua, Rivas and further cities, despite being prohibited by law (M. Lezama <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Costa Rica roughly a third of nests were raided, accounting for c.85% of the all nest failures observed (Wright <em>et al</em>. 2001; Grijalva 2008), although in another study conducted near Liberia, up to 100% of the nests located by researchers had been poached (A. Salinas-Melgoza <em>in litt</em>. 2011). In southern Guatemala, almost only those nests which are inaccessible by poachers successfully fledge young (L. Joyner <em>in litt</em>. 2021). The nest failure rate was generally found to be very high in  Costa Rica (89%), with the majority of nest failures found to result  from poaching for the pet trade (64%) (Dahlin <em>et al</em>. 2018). Poaching of nestlings can also affect future breeding in the species, as damage of nest trees when extracting nestlings can make the tree no longer usable as a nest site (C. Dahlin<em>&#160;per </em>A. Salinas-Melgoza <em>in litt. </em>2016). It is thought that twice as many are taken from the wild than are recorded in export, based on a mortality rate of 54% during capture and transit (PÃÂ©rez and ZÃÂºÃÂ±iga 1998 in Grijalva 2008), although a survival rate of one in three or four has also been reported (<em>per</em> O. Andino <em>in litt</em>. 2011).<br/>Anthropogenic threats are thought to exacerbate the effects of poor rates of recruitment to the breeding population (Grijalva 2008). In parts of the range, the species suffers from cavity occupation by Africanised Bees (R.  Bjork <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Climate change may also have an impact on the species as there have been hotter and longer dry seasons in the region, though the impact of this on the species is essentially currently unknown (C. Dahlin and T. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2016)."
"The only threat known to the species is habitat loss. However, forest loss within the range is low (3% over ten years; Global Forest Watch 2020) and much pristine habitat persists within the range (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). The species is currently not considered to be threatened by trapping (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020)."
"The only threat known to the species is habitat loss. Although forests within the range are largely inaccessible and relatively intact, they have been subject to selective logging and are being opened up for development and mining, with associated road-building and human colonisation (Dinerstein <em>et al.</em> 1995). There is currently no evidence that the species is captured for the pet trade (see Herrera and Hennessey 2008).<p></p>"
"Shifting cultivation, logging and bauxite mining have reduced suitable habitat. Bauxite mining licenses were recently issued for over 60% of the Cockpit Country Conservation Area, which supports over 90% of the global population of this species (Koenig 2008)<strong></strong>. Predation by Yellow Boa <em>Epicrates subflavus</em> is a significant limiting factor to nesting success: of the 26 nest-sites located during the 1997 breeding season, over 30% suffered total failure and another 6% partial mortality during the early nesting stage (Davis 1997)<strong></strong>. Nest predation is likely to increase with the increasing population of invasive rats and mongooses (L. Gibson <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Climate change is leading to an increased frequency of droughts within the range; this reduces the area and quality of habitat and causes the species to concentrate around fruiting trees near villages (L. Gibson <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In small numbers, the species is trapped for the local pet trade (Cawley <em>et al</em>. 2020, Gibson 2020)<strong></strong>. Instances of hybridisation with Puerto Rican Amazon <em>Amazona agilis </em>have been observed, as this species<em> </em>is thought to expand its range in response to severe droughts and hurricanes in Puerto Rico<em> </em><strong></strong>(Cawley <em>et al</em>. 2020, <strong></strong>L. Gibson <em>in litt</em>. 2020). <br/><p></p>"
"The main drivers of the species's historical decline are habitat loss as well as hunting (Salaman <em>et al</em>. 2019). In particular, habitat loss caused a lack of nest site availability, as dead wax palms were cut for use as durable fence posts and live palms were logged for Palm Sunday processions, decimating once abundant palm groves (P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Wax palms are very long-lived and slow-growing (mature individuals are over 500 years old)<strong> </strong>(Salaman 2001); they suffer poor recruitment  because cattle browse young trees, and logging in adjacent areas  increases their susceptibility to disease (Krabbe 1998<strong></strong>, Salaman <em>et al</em>. 1999a, b, P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 1999)<strong></strong>. Hunting is a further threat, as the species is easily approachable and largely oblivious to humans (Salaman <em>et al</em>. 2019, P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 2019). In Ecuador, hunting for food was prolific<strong> </strong> (Krabbe and Sornoza 1996, Salaman <em>et al</em>. 1999b)<strong></strong>, and trapping has had some impact in Colombia, although the species is notoriously hard to keep in captivity<strong> </strong>(Salaman <em>et al</em>. 1999b, Salaman 2001<strong></strong>)<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><strong></strong>. The population near Cubarral appears to be in decline, but the drivers of the decline are unknown (FundaciÃÂ³n ProAves <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<p></p>"
"Most of Ecuador's forests and mangroves have been cleared since the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, with aquaculture pond development for shrimp farming being the main driver of mangrove loss (B. Biddle <em>in litt</em>. 2014). The clearance and unsustainable use of mangroves may have slowed because of protection measures, but loud bird-scaring devices used at existing shrimp farms are likely to cause disturbance to the species (B. Biddle <em>in litt</em>. 2014). Overall, habitat loss and degradation driven by agricultural expansion, cutting of firewood and development are regarded as on-going threats to this species. Trapping pressure is another on-going threat; it is thought that a large proportion of the communities within the range keep the species as pets (Biddle <em>et al</em>. 2020). The population near Bahia de Caraquez has been severely reduced to the trapping (H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt</em>. 2020)."
"Below 900 m, the rate of deforestation in west Ecuador was 57% per decade in 1958-1988, although in the higher parts of its range, with steeper terrain and a harsher climate, deforestation is slower and a greater proportion of forest remains<strong></strong> (Dodson and Gentry 1991). In particular, rapid rates of logging around PiÃÂ±as and Manta Real occurred during the late 1980s and 1990s (N. Simpson <em>in litt.</em> 2000). Typically, these areas were then burnt for cattle-farming. Mining is an additional threat (H. M. Schaefer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Lack of suitable nesting trees may be a limiting factor and nesting at suboptimal sites may increase predation by species such as Crimson-rumped Toucanet<strong> </strong><em>Aulacorhynchus haematopygus</em><strong> </strong>(Anon. 2006, GarzÃÂ³n and JuiÃÂ±a 2007, Waugh 2007, GarzÃÂ³n <em>et al</em>. 2020)<strong></strong>. Its favoured nesting tree <em>Dacryodes peruviana </em>is highly sought after and frequently targeted for human use<strong> </strong>(GarzÃÂ³n and JuiÃÂ±a 2007).<em> </em>Subpopulations may be isolated due to habitat fragmentation; for example, genetic differentiation was found between groups only 2 km apart (Klauke <em>et al</em>. 2016). Owing to the cooperative breeding system, only ~50% of mature individuals reproduce in a given breeding season. The species suffers from limited genetic diversity, as reproductive output is directly related to the genetic diversity of flocks (Klauke <em>et al.</em> 2013). Inbreeding is known to occur, although its effects are unclear (H. M. Schaefer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2020). Climate change is apparently causing a very pronounced upslope shift in distribution (now 900-1,800 m within the Buenaventura valley where it was originally 600-1,100 m in the 1980s; Klauke <em>et al.</em> 2016), with a corresponding drastic shrinking of distribution size and available habitat similar to Ecuadorian Tapaculo (Hermes <em>et al. </em>2017).<p></p>"
"The species is thought to be marginally affected by habitat degradation due to ongoing forest loss (Tracewski<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2016, Global Forest Watch 2020). Adults and nestlings may also be trapped for the cagebird trade (S. Mahood <em>in litt</em>. 2020, J. Eaton <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Previously, it was for example considered to be over-trappied on Muna and Buton islands (Collar and Boesman 2020)."
"Trapping of adults and nestlings for the cagebird and pet trade are the most significant threats, with heavy trapping particularly extensive in the early 2000s (P. Widmann <em>in litt</em>. 2020, S. Mahood <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Scarcity of captured birds in markets (D. Gutierrez <em>per </em>N. Collar&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020) also suggests the genuine rarity of the species. There is also some level of forest loss across the species' range (Global Forest Watch 2020). Mining activities also continue to reduce habitats across Tawi-Tawi (D. Allen <em>in litt</em>. 2020)."
"The most severe threat to the species is trapping for the pet trade, which has led to local extirpations (CantÃÂº <em>et al</em>. 2007, J. C. CantÃÂº GuzmÃÂ¡n <em>per </em>R. Low <em>in litt</em>. 2017, Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). In general, trapping for the pet trade is a severe risk for parrot species; it constitutes one of the principal threats to Neotropical parrots and can lead to drastic population declines (Berkunsky <em>et al.</em> 2017). In Mexico, parrot trade was banned in 2008, but before then the species was trapped legally (CantÃÂº <em>et al</em>. 2007, J. C. CantÃÂº <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Between 1998 and 2008, over 8,000 individuals were legally captured, making it the second-most captured parrot species in Mexico (J. C. CantÃÂº <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Since the ban in 2008, illegal capturing is still ongoing in Mexico, albeit decreasing in recent years (CantÃÂº <em>et al</em>. 2007, J. C. CantÃÂº <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Trapping has also been recorded in Costa Rica and El Salvador (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). A further threat is habitat loss and degradation; however due to its tolerance of converted habitats the species is not severely affected by habitat destruction (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020)."
"<p>The species is threatened by deforestation. About 22% of its distribution overlaps with the proposed Orinoco Mining Arc (C. J. Sharpe<em> in litt</em>. 2019); however, large areas of undisturbed forest remains within the range (A. Lees <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species is further susceptible to hunting and  capture for international trade (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020, S. Bruslund <em>in litt</em>. 2022). </p><p></p>  <p><br/></p>"
"Less than 0.06% remains of the original old-growth forest cover in the Sierra Madre Occidental ecoregion (Ortiz-Maciel and Cruz-Nieto 2004)<strong></strong>. Historically, there has been an extensive modification of old-growth pine forests for timber and woodpulp. In the Sierra Madre Occidental, 80-85% of forest cover remains, but only 0.6% is old-growth (Lammertink <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. In 1994, there was extensive penetration and degradation of habitat in south Chihuahua by drug-growers, loggers and huge numbers of cattle. In the same year, forest stands at Mesa de Guacamayas were heavily burned (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004)<strong></strong>. Logging has been intensive in the Sierra Madre Occidental, with no large fragments of old growth forest remaining in northern areas (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004)<strong></strong>. Commercial logging in the area involves the removal of larger trees and standing dead wood, and appears to reduce nest-site availability by leaving few snags and pine trees large enough for the species to nest in. Such large-scale logging operations across the species's historic range may be responsible for its decline (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004)<strong></strong>. As a result of habitat loss, the breeding strongholds are now concentrated in two areas; Cebadillas de Yahuirachi and Madera (Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. Fire remains a serious threat to the species (M. A. Cruz-Nieto <em>et al.</em> <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. <br/> Illegal trade in the species has fluctuated with peaks in the early 1970s and mid-1980s. Unofficial records confirm that the species is taken for illegal trade, but the extent of trapping is not known (M. A. Cruz-Nieto <em>et al.</em> <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. <br/>Climate change may have an impact on habitat availability for this species, particularly during the breeding season: depending on the climate change scenario, the climatically suitable area for the species may shrink to only 25-70% of the current extent by 2090 (Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al. </em>2015).<br/><p></p>"
"While primary forest has previously declined in extent, a decline in the quality of forest on the island may not be affecting the species, as the population trend of this species is actually a relatively rapid increase and the highest numbers are found around gardens containing papaya (although only when adjacent to forest habitat). There has been an illicit pet trade (Primot 2000) which is thought to have increased through the second half of the 20th century (Robinet <em>et al. </em>1995).&#160;Nesting holes are cut open to extract the nestlings, rendering them unsuitable for future breeding attempts and a lack of nesting sites is believed to be a limiting factor. The continuous presence of local guides is believed to be effectively preventing nest poaching (BarrÃÂ© <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010), although it has been reported that some poaching effort appears to have resumed, including the illegal culling of birds in gardens (J. Theuerkauf <em>in litt. </em>2017, 2020). The invasion of the island in 1996 by bees, which compete for tree holes, is a significant threat, with 10-16% of known nests being occupied by bees in 2000-2002 (N. BarrÃÂ© <em>in litt. </em>2003). The native Brown Goshawk <em>Accipiter fasciatus,</em> and perhaps other predators, are believed to take many juveniles (Robinet <em>et al.</em> 1996; N. BarrÃÂ© <em>in litt.</em> 1999; P. Primot <em>in litt.</em> 1999; Robinet and Salas 1999)<strong></strong>. Suitable habitat is patchy and fragmented mainly as a result of coconut plantations, which do not afford protection from predation by <em>A. fasciatus</em> and so act as barriers to dispersal. Two Black Rats,&#160;<em>Rattus rattus,</em>&#160;have recently been trapped near the harbour, although there is no evidence that the species has yet become established on the island (J. Theuerkauf <em>in litt.</em> 2016, 2017). Previously, experiments showed that egg-predation rates were four times higher on the island of Lifou, where <em>R. rattus </em>was present, compared to Ouvea, where they were absent (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 1998). The introduced Rainbow Lorikeet&#160;<em>Trichoglossus</em>&#160;<em>haematodus </em>may pose a threat through competition (although it has different habitat and dietary requirements so competition is unlikely), or through transmission of Beak and Feather Disease virus (BFDV) (Jackson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014)."
"Forest loss within its elevation range in recent decades may have caused a decline in its population. There was also, at least formerly, limited trapping for the bird trade (e.g. 2,131 birds reported in 1991 but no quotas set between 1994-1995; Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160;Therefore, whilst it is suspected to be decreasing, due to high detectability in offshore islands south of Sulawesi in recent years, and knowledge of its somewhat apparent tolerance to edge and degraded habitat, it is not considered to be at immediate risk.&#160;<p></p>"
"Conversion of forest for agricultural purposes has been widespread below 3,300&#160;m in the Central Andes. At higher elevations, the forest is exploited for firewood and grazing, but large areas remain. Given its adaptation to the agricultural environment, the level of threat posed by deforestation is unknown<strong> </strong>(Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000). Conversely, widespread destruction of pÃÂ¡ramo vegetation, even in Los Nevados, seems to have seriously affected numbers. This is caused by frequent burning (promoting fresh shooting), intense grazing and, to a lesser extent, conversion to potato cultivation. The Colombian authorities have been unable to purchase pre-existing landholdings within national parks, often rendering the parks ineffective. Wildfires are increasing in intensity and frequency, threatening large areas within the range (Renjifo <em>et al</em>. 2016). The species is sometimes kept as a cagebird.<br/><br/><br/><p></p>"
"Habitat loss and fragmentation in the species's range is low (J. Criado<em> in litt</em>. 2007; Global Forest Watch 2021)<strong></strong>. Destruction of foothill and highland forests is primarily the result of burning, small-scale logging operations and other conversion for agricultural use, including plantations of pineapple, sugarcane and coffee (Dinerstein <em> et al.</em> 1995; G. R. Angehr <em>in litt</em>. 2007; J. SÃÂ¡nchez<em> in litt</em>. 2007; C. SÃÂ¡nchez <em>in litt</em>. 2021)<strong></strong>. In Panama, deforestation is also taking place for urban and tourism development in highlands (G. R. Angehr <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Virtually all remaining highland forest in Costa Rica is confined to existing protected areas (Stiles and Skutch 1989)<strong></strong>. Forest clearance is higher in the lowlands and mid-elevation (Global Forest Watch 2021; C. SÃÂ¡nchez <em>in litt</em>. 2021); even though the species does not depend on these forests, logging may impact it in the wet season (F. G. Stiles <em>in litt</em>. 1999; J. Criado<em> in litt</em>. 2007). <br/>Climate change effects might cause a contraction and/or shift of the distribution range (Sekercioglu <em>et al</em>. 2012). There are no reports of captive birds; consequently any pressure from trade must be extremely low at most (Collar 1997; Collar and Boesman 2020)<strong></strong>. <p></p>"
"The species is threatened by the continuing loss and degradation of its forest habitat (Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000; Botero-Delgadillo and PÃÂ¡ez 2011; Renjifo <em>et al</em>. 2014; SERFOR 2018). Improvements to road networks lead to deforestation associated with human encroachment, agriculture and settlement of new areas. Habitat loss is occurring even within protected areas (Renjifo <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><strong></strong><p></p>"
"The illegal cage-bird trade and habitat loss are the principal threats (Rosales and Obando 2011; S. Crespo <em>in litt</em>. 2012)<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>. In western Ecuador the species is among the most common pet parrots (Biddle <em>et al</em>. 2021). Surveys carried out in 2007-2008 and in 2007-2011 found the species being traded in several markets in Peru (GastaÃÂ±aga <em>et al</em>. 2011; Daut <em>et al</em>. 2015). <br/>Natural habitats are being destroyed through agricultural conversion, logging and grazing by goats and cattle, which prevents forest regeneration, seriously threatens deciduous forests<strong></strong> and possibly depletes suitable nesting sites (Pople <em>et al.</em> 1997; Collar and Boesman 2020). Over the last three generations, 4% of tree cover within the range has been lost (Global Forest Watch 2021).<br/><p></p>"
"The most severe threat to the species is the loss and degradation of its forest habitat. Forest loss has been occurring in the Magdalena valley in Colombia for at least four centuries, but accelerated markedly throughout the 20th century<strong> </strong>(Stiles <em>et al.</em> 1999). Most forest on the eastern slopes of the SerranÃÂ­a de San Lucas has been lost since 1996<strong></strong> (A. Cuervo <em>in litt</em>. 1999; L. DÃÂ¡valos <em>in litt</em>. 1999; P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 1999)<strong></strong>. Recent estimates show that tree cover within the range is lost at a rate of 5% over three generations (Global Forest Watch 2021). Forest is mainly logged for settlement, agriculture and mining<strong></strong> (Cuervo and Salaman 1999; A. Cuervo <em>in litt</em>. 1999; L. DÃÂ¡valos <em>in litt</em>. 1999; P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 1999<strong></strong>; Stiles <em>et al.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. <br/>Locally, individuals are captured for the pet trade (G. Stiles <em>in litt</em>. 1999; Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000; Sharpe 2008; Renjifo <em>et al.</em> 2016)<strong></strong>. In Sierra de PerijÃÂ¡, Venezuela, it is also hunted for food (C. J. Sharpe <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011).<br/><p></p>"
"The species is threatened by deforestation and degradation of its habitat (Collar and Boesman 2020). Historical localities in the northern East Andes of Colombia are now wholly deforested (Juniper and Parr 1998; P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 1999)<strong></strong>. Only about 20% of its range in Colombia is covered by protected areas, which is below the recommended 40% (VelÃÂ¡squez-TibatÃÂ¡ and LÃÂ³pez-ArÃÂ©valo 2006; Botero-Delgadillo and PÃÂ¡ez 2011; E. Botero-Delgadillo<em> in litt</em>. 2021). Vast areas have been logged, cleared and used for agriculture, illegal drug plantations, infrastructure development and mining (Stiles <em>et al</em>. 1999; Renjifo <em>et al</em>. 2014). Frequent burning, intense grazing and, locally, potato cultivation continue to lower the timberline in many areas. In Venezuela, clearing of forests for livestock and agriculture reduces available habitat (Sharpe 2008; Pelayo and Soriano 2014; C. Sharpe <em>in litt</em>. 2021). Trade of this species is virtually non-existent (Collar and Boesman 2020), so any trapping may be extremely low.<br/><p></p>"
"The major threat to the species is forest loss for cattle pasture  and selective logging for timber and  firewood (Renjifo <em>et al</em>. 2014). Most mature trees with natural cavities have been logged, creating a shortage of natural nesting sites. Clearance of forest in the region of the type-locality was already extensive in 1911, and it is estimated that the species has lost almost 50% of its original habitat (Renjifo <em>et al</em>. 2014). Deforestation rates have however slowed down considerably in recent  years, amounting to &lt;1% over the past ten years (Global Forest Watch  2021). A large gold reserve was discovered close to a key population, however, the threat of deforestation was mitigated when FundaciÃÂ³n ProAves purchased and protected 294 ha of critical habitat (FundaciÃÂ³n ProAves <em>per </em>P. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Trapping has likely also contributed to past declines, albeit at a low rate (FundaciÃÂ³n ProAves <em>per </em>A. Cortes <em>in litt</em>. 2021).<p></p>"
"Habitat destruction is the principal concern, as upper tropical zone forests east of the Andes are being cleared at an alarming rate. However, subtropical forests in Podocarpus National Park and Cordillera del CÃÂ³ndor are largely intact<strong> </strong>(Schulenberg and Awbrey 1997; Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000<strong></strong>). Logging has been extensive at lower elevations within its range (to c.1,000-1,200&#160;m), and is gradually encroaching on core altitudes. In the Cordillera de CutucÃÂº, some forest has been cleared for agriculture and to secure indigenous people legal ownership of their land. Illegal gold mining and human settlement occur, even within Podocarpus National Park, particularly at its southern boundary<strong> </strong>(Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000). In the Peruvian part of its range, there is little or no threat of deforestation; however, there is a mining concession in the area (F. Angulo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012; SERFOR 2018). It is trapped in small numbers for the domestic cage-bird trade<strong> </strong>(Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000; Collar and Boesman 2020).<br/><p>&#160;</p><br/><p></p>"
"The species suffers heavily from local trade in Peru and Ecuador, where it is a common and highly sought-after pet (Best and Clarke 1991;  Williams and Tobias 1994; Best <em>et al.</em> 1995)<strong></strong>. Estimating the numbers taken from the wild is complicated, as its status is often clouded by the misdeclaring of traded birds<strong></strong> and pre-trade mortality<strong> </strong>(Inskipp and Corrigan 1992; Best <em>et al.</em> 1995). The species is frequently confiscated by the Ecuadorian authorities<strong></strong> (E. Horstman <em>in litt</em>. 2011; R. Orrantia and J. Baquerizo<em> in litt</em>. 2011).<p></p>"
"The species has been heavily traded and wild-caught individuals have been recorded in international trade before it was listed on CITES Appendix II (UNEP-WCMC CITES Trade Database). In Peru, over 16,000 individuals were exported in 1982 (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). International trade decreased substantially afterwards, but rose again in the early 1990s (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). The  species is locally sold in bird markets, but is  apparently not  among the most commonly occurring parrot species in  local trade  (GastaÃÂ±aga <em>et al</em>. 2011; Biddle <em>et al</em>. 2021). It is also persecuted because of its status as a crop pest (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997). Although the species is tolerant of modified habitats, it is assumed that land-use change is contributing to the negative population trend."
"Its original natural habitat is inter-Andean dry forest but this has been degraded to thorn and cactus scrub by centuries (if not millennia) of highly unsustainable human activities, nowadays mainly overgrazing by goats, firewood cutting and charcoal production<strong> </strong>(S. K. Herzog <em>in litt. </em>2007). An estimated 40% of natural vegetation in valleys within its range had been converted to agriculture by 1991, with other areas degraded by intense grazing. Several important food trees are harvested for fuel and charcoal. As food plants are lost, agricultural land is used more, thereby increasing the species's exposure to persecution as a crop-pest, and the use of firearms for pest control has been recorded<strong> </strong>(Brace <em>et al.</em> 1995). Macaws are also potentially threatened by pesticides applied to crops where macaws forage mostly during the non-breeding season (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012). <br/>Illegal trapping continues, but has been reduced as a result of legal protection<strong></strong> (Pitter and Christiansen 1995; <strong></strong>Juniper and Parr 1998; Herrera and Hennessey 2007;<strong> </strong>A. Rojas <em>in litt. </em>2007). The majority of the Bolivian parrot trade is domestic, but more valuable threatened species end up in Peru or further afield. 26 Red-fronted Macaws were recorded passing through the Los Pozos pet market, Santa Cruz between August 2004-July 2005, and there are four other wildlife markets in the city and others in Cochabamba, suggesting this figure may only represent a small proportion of birds illegally trafficked in the country<strong> </strong>(Herrera and Hennessey 2007). In 2011, 45 Red-fronted Macaws were recorded in houses; some had been taken from nests as nestlings, but most of them were trapped when foraging in crops. In 2017, more than 100 individuals were found as cage birds in local communities (J. L. Tella <em>in litt.</em> 2017). Most were kept as pets, but some were to sell to in major cities (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012). The two main threats appear to be nest-poaching and trapping for local pet supply, and persecution as crop pests (especially in corn and peanut cultivations), and possibly contamination by pesticides applied to crops  (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012; J. L. Tella <em>in litt</em>. 2017). <br/><p></p>"
"The species was severely threatened in the past by legal and illegal exploitation for the national and international cage-bird trade (A. Hesse <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>1999; I. Berkunsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012), although this has been radically reduced since 1984 (I. Berkunsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Nevertheless, in 2010 illegal trading of two recently-poached wild juvenile Blue-throated Macaws was uncovered&#160;(Berkunsky&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). The juveniles were eventually released into the wild, however this demonstrates that illegal poaching does still occur.<br/> All known breeding sites are on private cattle-ranches, where burning and clearing for pasture and tree-felling for fuel and fence posts have reduced the number of suitable nest trees and inhibited palm regeneration<strong> </strong>(Duffield and Hesse 1997; Hesse 1998; J. Gilardi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. Cattle-rearing has occurred in the region since the 17th century (A.

Hennessey <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Nest-site competition from other macaws, toucans, bats and large woodpeckers is significant, and disturbance from mammals, birds and human activity may reduce the reproductive output of some pairs (J. Gilardi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Between 2007 and 2012, 30 nests were monitored. Of these nests, 57% failed, with most failures occurring during incubation (Berkunsky <em>et al</em>. 2014). Reasons for nest failure were diverse but included disease, predation and abandonment. Botfly (<em>Philornis</em> spp.) infestations have been responsible for nest failures as have bees colonising nest sites, extreme weather events and parental neglect (Gould 2013a). Nestlings are vulnerable to predation from Toco Toucan <em>Ramphastos toco</em>, Crane Hawk <em>Geranospiza caerulescens</em>, Great-horned Owl <em>Bubo virginianus&#160;</em>and Southern-crested Caracara <em>Caracara plancus</em> (Gould 2013a). Hunting to provide feathers for indigenous headdresses probably has an important impact in some areas (I. Berkunsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). <br/>There are fears that inbreeding within an increasingly fragmented population is resulting in reduced fertility<strong></strong> (Loro Parque FundaciÃÂ³n 2003). This is compounded by a lack of recruitment to the breeding population; during a five year study, no new breeding pairs were recruited (Berkunsky&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Disease also represents a significant threat, particularly in areas where the species shares water sources with other bird species (Gould 2013a). A Population Viability Analysis found that changes in adult mortality had the greatest impact on estimates of extinction probability and population growth rates and that habitat loss and poaching also affected these estimates (Strem and Bouzat 2012).<p></p>"
"The species is commonly found in markets in Brazil, being valuable and in high demand owing to its perceived rarity. Reported international trade is low (and virtually unknown before 1995), but apparently increasing: three specimens in 1993 increased to 55 birds in 2000, totalling 150 birds for the whole period; as many as 50 were reported to have been seized or traded illegally. The species has a very low reproductive rate and continued illegal harvest is thought likely to pose a serious threat to its survival (IUCN-SSC and TRAFFIC 2002). <br/><br/>Much of the forest within the range is still intact, but deforestation rates appear to be increasing in recent years, amounting to 4.5% over the past 15 years (Global Forest Watch 2021). At least in Bolivia, forest is threatened by expansion of the logging industry, as well as mining and drilling for gas. The species may however tolerate or even benefit from the clearance of forest patches (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><p></p>"
"The main threat is from poaching for pets and the pet trade (C. J. Sharpe&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011, 2021; Rojas-SuÃÂ¡rez and RodrÃÂ­guez 2015). In Venezuela, this species is the 4<sup>th</sup> most traded parrot (SÃÂ¡nchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2020). Individuals are widely exploited for trade, serving a strong internal pet market; many chicks taken in Bonaire are believed to end up in CuraÃÂ§ao (R. Martin and S. Williams <em>in litt.</em> 2007; Martin 2009). Additionally, in some areas it is hunted for allegedly damaging crops (RodrÃÂ­guez and Rojas-SuÃÂ¡rez 1995; Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000; BriceÃÂ±o-Linares <em>et al</em>. 2011; Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). Negative attitudes due to its perception as a crop pest in agricultural  and urban areas of Bonaire may encourage persecution and undermine  support for conservation efforts (R. Martin and S. Williams <em>in litt.</em> 2012).<br/>Habitat loss and degradation are a further threat. An impoverishment of food resources and lack of mature trees for nest sites  are feared to limit the effective population size. Tourist and associated developments are destroying habitat, especially on Margarita, where the principal breeding, roosting and feeding-sites are threatened by unregulated mining for construction materials (Collar 1997; Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong></strong>. Dry forests and spiny scrub cover have become extensively reduced on Margarita and are now considered to be among the most endangered ecosystems on this island (Provita <em>in litt</em>. 2020). On Bonaire, natural vegetation has been heavily degraded historically  for timber and charcoal production, and more recently through intensive  grazing by goats and donkeys, drastically reducing natural food species  diversity and availability (A. O. Debrot <em>in litt</em>. 1999, 2007)<strong></strong>. In the eastern part of the mainland range, habitat is being lost through timber extraction and urban and industrial development (V. S. D'Angelo <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). Habitat modification for aquaculture and shrimp farming is an emerging threat in the western part of the mainland range (E. Blanco <em>per </em>Provita <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160; <br/>Introduced mammalian predators appear to limit its reproductive potential on Bonaire (R. Martin and S. Williams <em>in litt.</em> 2007; Martin 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Also on La Blanquilla, introduced predators including domestic cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) are feared to drive a population decline (Provita <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<br/><p></p>"
"The principal threat to this species is deforestation driven by selective logging, fires and habitat conversion to pasture or soybean plantations (Olmos <em>et al</em>. 1997; Bianchi 2008). Dry forest in GoiÃÂ¡s decreased in extent from 15.8 % of the state in 1990 to only 5.8 % in 1999, and less than 1 % of the remaining fragments were larger than 100 ha<strong>&#160;</strong>(Andahur 2001). As the area of remaining forest has decreased, the rate of conversion to pasture and plantations has lessened, but selective logging continues to degrade and remove remaining forest (T. Dornas <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Logging mainly targets durable woods that include most of the species's native foodplants, for use as fence poles and for improvements to farms (T. Dornas&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). It is likely that logging reduces the availability of hollow trees for nesting (T. Dornas <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Cement companies are beginning to target areas of limestone outcrops<strong>&#160;</strong>(C. A. Bianchi&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2006). Small areas of forest are flooded as the result of the construction of small hydroelectric power plants (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018). Future hydroelectric plant developments in tributaries such as the Inferno and&#160;SÃÂ£o Domingos rivers could potentially flood thousands of hectares of remaining habitat (T. Dornas, <em>pers. comm</em>., in Dornas and Pinheiro 2018; T. Dornas <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Recently, small scale sugarcane and soybean plantations are replacing old pastures in some areas in the surroundings of Terra Ronca State Park, the only conservation unit with significant size within the speciesÃ¢ÂÂs range (T. Dornas <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020).<br/><br/>The species is rarely recorded in trade or exotic bird collections but this poses a potential threat (Olmos <em>et al</em>. 1997). The species is sometimes shot when foraging in rice and corn fields (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018).<p></p>The species may be at risk from habitat alteration as a result of climate change (Borges <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019)."
"The primary threat to the species is the invasive Black Rat <em>Rattus rattus</em>. The species's extinction from many islands is most likely due to predation by Black Rat, and to a lesser extent, feral cats <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Felis catus</span> (Lovegrove<em> et al</em>. 1989).&#160;Although its range reduction in the Society Islands correlates with the spread of the introduced Swamp Harrier&#160;<em>Circus approximans&#160;</em>(Holyoak and Thibault 1984), surveys across 28 islands in French Polynesia found that, although the introduction of the swamp harrier could have accelerated the declines of&#160;<em>Vini</em>&#160;species, the main threat was the presence of&#160;the Black Rat<em>&#160;</em>(Seitre and Seitre 1992). Surveys of islands across French Polynesia have found that the lorikeet is usually absent, or is present only in very low numbers on islands where&#160;Black Rat&#160;is present (Seitre and Seitre 1992; Ziembick and Raust 2006). The accidental introduction of black rats (<em>Rattus rattus</em>) to the islands where Blue Lorikeet persists is a continuing threat to the species, especially in the Tuamotu archipelago, where all range islands are inhabited and copra exploitation is ongoing on most islands, providing opportunities for rat introductions (C. Blanvillain <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>The species's extinction from Makatea in the Tuamotus could have been accelerated by a particularly violent cyclone (Thibault and Guyot 1987)<strong></strong>. A cyclone in 2010 caused damage to c.75% of trees on Aitutaki (G. McCormack pers. comm 2010, in Jennings 2011) and resulted in the loss of over 50% of the lorikeet population (Jennings 2011), although the long-term impact is not known. Climate change is predicted to cause an increase in the frequency and intensity of storms, potentially affecting the lorikeet.<br/><br/>Habitat loss through conversion to tree plantations, agriculture and urbanisation also presents a threat, as the species relies on dead trees for nesting. Habitat may also be lost through sea level rise as a result of climate change. The species is sometimes trapped for the pet trade.<p></p>"
"This species is threatened by the loss of its forest habitat. Logging in the Solomon Islands is increasing, and the species does not seem to utilise agricultural or urban environments (J. Wood <em>in litt. </em>2019). This species is also threatened by the domestic and international caged bird trade. Between 1998-2013, 4,930 wild-caught individuals were traded internationally (CITES 2021), roughly equivalent to c.380 individuals per year. Between 2014-2019, 4,163 individuals were traded internationally (CITES 2021), roughly equivalent to c.830 individuals per year, indicating that the demand for this species, and subsequent trade, has increased dramatically in recent years. 14,164 individuals labelled as captive bred birds were also traded between 1998-2013, and 50 were recorded between 2014-2019 (CITES 2021), however the Solomon Islands do not have any captive-breeding facilities or functioning registered breeders (Shepherd&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), suggesting that these birds were actually mislabelled wild-caught individuals, and therefore the true number of traded wild birds may be much higher. Between 2005-2014, this species made up 3.5% of birds imported into Singapore (Poole and Shepherd 2017)."
"Historically, the widespread clearance of lowland forest on Java undoubtedly caused wide-ranging declines on the island, with the species now remaining only in well-forested areas (although it is evidently tolerant of degradation and secondary forests (Eaton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021, eBird 2023). However, forest cover loss on Java this century has been minimal (Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Higginbottom&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, Global Forest Watch 2023), and the only contemporary threat thought to be driving declines in this species is capture for the cagebird trade. There is evidence for increasing demand of this species for the cagebird trade over the past decade, and this is suspected to be driving moderately rapid population declines. Market data show a possible increase in demand from&#160;<em>c</em>.2016/2017, broadly in line with an increase in cagebird ownership on Java over the past decade (cf. Jepson and Ladle 2009, Marshall&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). For example, an inventory of a Jakarta market found none in July 2014 but 68 in July 2019 (Anon.&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2021); while a survey of Bali bird markets found 11 in 2017, but 52 in 2018 (Chng&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160; Other surveys on Java similarly reported previously low numbers: one at Bandung market in September 2016 and only two in East Java in 2015 (Chng and Eaton 2016). Conversely, Okarda&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2022) found none for sale among 284,118 birds listed online between April 2020 and September 2021, and Marshall&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2020) found only a single bird kept among 3,000 households. There is no evidence that this species is traded internationally, with most, if not probably all, the demand for this Indonesian (Java and Bali) endemic coming from within the species' native range.<p></p>"

"The species is regarded as a crop pest; potential threats are direct persecution, poisoning and the loss and disturbance of its nesting sites due to intentional burning of nests (Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Agua 2009, T. Boorsma <em>in litt</em>. 2022). Occasionally, the species is kept as a cage-bird (Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Agua 2009)."
"There has been extensive and continuing clearance and fragmentation of suitable habitat for coffee, soybean and sugarcane plantations in SÃÂ£o Paulo, and cattle-ranching in GoiÃÂ¡s and Minas Gerais (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000). Tree cover within the range is lost at a rate of 13% over three generations (Global Forest Watch 2021, using Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2013] data and methods disclosed therein). However, the species is still widespread and has not declined over much   of its northern range (Bahia, Minas Gerais, GoiÃÂ¡s) and it is able to   cope with habitat fragmentation, suggesting that its status is more secure than   formerly thought. Trapping for trade has probably had a significant impact since it was relatively common in illegal Brazilian markets in the mid-1980s and imported in hundreds into West Germany in the early 1980s. However, the precise effect is obfuscated by high numbers of captive-bred birds, which presumably reduce pressure on remaining wild populations (L. F. Silveira <em>in litt.</em> 1999). Despite its tendency to occasionally nest near human habitation, it is apparently not the most favoured species for the pet trade (V. T. Lombardi<em> in litt</em>. 2011). There are no records of persecution in response to crop degradation.<br/><p></p>"

"Excessive exploitation for its red feathers is the most likely reason for the species' extinction from the Cook Islands (Watling 1995,<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&#160;</span><strong></strong>McCormack and KÃÂ¼nzle 1996)<strong></strong>. <br/>Currently, the main threat to the species is potential colonisation by Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus </em>(Seitre and Seitre 1992, Blanvillain and Ghestemme 2015) which are absent from Rimatara and Atiu (Gouni<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2007; Blanvillain <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2015b; Lieberman<em> et al. </em>2018) and are believed to be preventing the species from establishing on Mitiaro (McCormack 2017). The introduction of Black Rats is generally considered the main cause of lorikeet extinction (Thibault and Cibois 2017) and introduction to Rimatara or Atiu would likely cause the rapid decimation of these populations. Polynesian Rats <em>Rattus exulans, </em>Brown Rats <em>Rattus norvegicus </em>and feral cats <em>Felis catus </em>are present, though unlikely to be driving significant declines. The Common Myna&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Acridotheres tristis&#160;</span>was previously a threat to the introduced population on Atiu as it competed for nesting sites and was reported to attack fledglings (Lieberman and McCormack 2008, Malcolm 2008, Heptonstall 2010), though the species was successfully eradicated in 2016 (Lieberman <em>et al.</em> 2018).

"The primary threat to this species is accelerating rates of deforestation in the Amazon basin, as forests are converted for farming and agricultural purposes (Soares-Filho <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2006, Bird <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011).

[2013] data and methods disclosed therein). Despite being common in undisturbed landscapes, this species is not thought to be tolerant of secondary forest or agropastoral land and appears restricted to alluvial habitats. It may also be susceptible to hunting and trapping for domestic trade (A. Lees<em> in litt</em>. 2011, Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). It is currently not recorded in international trade (S.

"Agricultural conversion and deforestation for mining and plantations have historically threatened the species' habitats<strong></strong> (Fearnside 1996).

"The species is susceptible to trapping for trade, which is considered the main driver of rapid population declines, particularly in the past. Around 20,000 individuals were exported from Argentina in the mid to late 1980s<strong> </strong>(L. Rivera<em> in litt</em>. 2004). In the 1980s, c.5,400 individuals were captured in Bolivia for the international pet trade prior to it being listed by CITES<strong> </strong>(Rivera<strong> </strong><em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2009). After it was placed on Appendix I of CITES, international trade was effectively cut off, although local exploitation continues at a reduced scale<strong> </strong>(L.

"The most severe threat to this species currently is the degradation of forested habitat through grazing and trampling by cattle, which is hindering the regeneration of trees important for nesting and feeding (N.

Forest destruction reached highest levels between the 1910s and 1940s (ICMBio 2018, Fernandes <em>et al</em>. 2019).  In 1914, 25% of Rio Grande do Sul was forested; by 1988 this area had shrunk to 3% as a result of logging for timber and fuelwood, intense grazing and livestock trampling, as well as over-exploitation of non-timber forest products, notably <em>Araucaria</em> seeds, which possibly explains the range shift to Santa Catarina<strong> </strong>(Snyder <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2000). Currently, tree cover is lost at a rate of up to 10% over three generations (31.2 years; Global Forest Watch 2021, using Hansen <em>et al</em>. [2013] data and methods disclosed therein). A planned wind farm in Santa Catarina may pose a threat to the species during migration (Fernandes <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/>There is an organised internal trade, with parrots usually taken by cutting the nesting-tree, resulting in permanent abandonment. The illegal pet trade has however reduced in recent years as a result of environmental education and awareness campaigns in local communities (N. P. Prestes and J. Martinez <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Despite a reduction in pressure, poaching and illegal trade are still ongoing locally (Fernandes <em>et al</em>. 2019). Nest monitoring revealed that over ten  years about one-quarter of nests were poached (Vannucchi <em>et al</em>. 2022). A further potential threat is the outbreak of diseases including Avian Bornavirus and Psittacine Circoviral Disease, which are currently present in captive populations of parrots in Brazil and may reach wild populations in the near future (Vannucchi <em>et al</em>. 2022).<br/><br/><p></p>"
"The primary threat to this species is accelerating deforestation in the   Amazon Basin, as land is cleared for cattle ranching and soy production,  facilitated by expansion of the road network (Soares-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2006, Bird <em>et al.</em> 2011). Currently, large parts of the range are still pristine, e.g. in Suriname (O. Ottema <em>in litt</em>. 2020). However, the subpopulation in the Atlantic Forest in Brazil may be more severely affected by habitat loss, as deforestation in this part of the range is higher than in other areas, proceeding at a rate equivalent to 21% over three generations (Fernandes <em>et al</em>. 2019, Global Forest Watch 2021, using Hansen <em>et al</em>. [2013] data and methods disclosed therein). Changes to the Brazilian Forest Code reduced the  percentage of land a private landowner is legally required to maintain  as forest (including, critically, a reduction in the width of forest  buffers alongside perennial steams) and include an amnesty for  landowners who deforested before July 2008 (Bird <em>et al. </em>2011).  This new environmental policy is seemingly incentivising farmers to clear more land, and deforestation rates and wildfire intensity in the Brazilian Amazon have increased drastically since 2018 (S. Dantas <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species is heavily hunted for food in French Guiana and persecuted as a crop pest in Ecuador (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020, D. F. Cisneros-Heredia <em>in litt</em>. 2022). Trapping pressure  for domestic and international trade is assumed to be much more widespread, with trade levels in  this species described as generally moderate, but heavy in some  countries and increasing in recent years (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997, S. Bruslund <em>in litt</em>. 2022, D. F. Cisneros-Heredia <em>in litt</em>. 2022)."

"Trapping for the bird trade may be the cause of reported recent population reductions with direct observations of the export of parrots from Biak to Java (M. Halaouate&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012). Papua is noted as a major source for parrots (Indraswari <em>et al. </em>2020), including the <em>Trichoglossus haematodus </em>group (Setiani and Ahmadi 2020)&#160;but there is no quantification of trade from Biak and this is an urgent area of required research.<br/>Forest on Biak has come under heavy pressure from logging and subsistence farming, though large-scale logging has not been economically feasible for some time (Wikramanayake&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002). Significant tracts of forest remain in the largely inaccessible areas of Biak Utara and Supiori, considered secure. The rate of forest cover loss recorded through satellite monitoring has been slow in the past two decades, and over the past three generations of the species the maximum rate is estimated at 3.6% (Global Forest Watch 2021, using Hansen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;[2013] data and methods disclosed therein)."
"The most severe threat to the species is the loss of its habitat. Large areas of lowland forests within the range are already severely altered or have been fully cleared (ICMBio 2018). Deforestation in the Amazon basin is expected to increase further as land is  cleared for cattle ranching and soy production, facilitated by expansion  of the road network (Soares-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2006, Bird <em>et al.</em> 2011).

Despite an apparent tolerance of some habitat degradation, the species is perhaps close to extinction in coastal areas of north MaranhÃÂ£o, owing to large-scale deforestation (Juniper and Parr 1998). It occurs within protected areas, but their integrity is compromised by illegal logging (Juniper and Parr 1998). There is currently no evidence that the species is suffering from trapping pressure (R. SubirÃÂ¡ <em>in litt</em>. 2022).<p></p>"

"Relatively large numbers were previously trapped for the domestic and international trade (Nash 1990, K. D. Bishop <em>in litt</em>. 1994)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and this species was commonly observed as a pet on Biak (Bishop 1982)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Recently trapping pressure has been reported to be high and causing further declines on Biak (Bergmark 2019, M. Halaouate <em>in litt. </em>2022), noting that numbers were previously reduced here (K. D. Bishop <em>in&#160; litt. </em>2000).&#160;<br/><br/>Forest on Biak has come under heavy pressure from logging and subsistence farming, though large-scale logging has not been economically feasible for some time (Wikramanayake&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002).

The species is tolerant of degraded forest but does require forest cover, hence it is unclear that this low rate of forest cover loss will be driving a significant population reduction. Much of Supiori comprises virtually impenetrable, forested limestone mountains, which is likely to be safe from habitat degradation.<br/><br/>Large areas of forest on Biak have previously been destroyed or damaged by logging and subsistence farming, particularly the southern plains (Bishop 1982, K.D.

There is also a proposal for a spaceport on the eastern side of Biak, which would cause the loss of 6.5km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of Protection Forest (Perwitasari and Susanti 2019) and may result in further development (e.g. expanded and improved road infrastructure and increased settlement in the area).<p></p>"
"<p><a name=""_Hlk63511383""><span lang=""EN-AU"">Nest hollow shortage is considered the principal threat as suitable hollows are considered scarce, only forming in trees at least 120 years old (Whitford <em>et al.</em> 2015). </a><span lang=""EN-AU"">Many suitable trees have been preferentially felled for their timber (Abbott and Whitford 2001, Chapman 2008) and continue to be lost to mining (Chapman 2008), and there is competition for remaining hollows from <em>Z.&#160;latirostris</em>, white cockatoos <em>Cacatua</em> spp., <em>Polytelis anthopeplus</em>,<em>&#160;</em>&#160;<em>Chenonetta jubata</em> and European honey bees <em>Apis mellifera</em> all successfully displacing Baudin's Black-cockatoos (Johnstone and Kirkby 2008, Chapman 2008, TSSC 2018). Fire, both wildfire and controlled burns, destroys nest trees, may promote disease of nest and feeding trees and can reduce the availability of food from mature marri (Mastrantonis <em>et al.</em> 2019), a threat likely to intensify if the probability of fire continues to increase (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2016). Plant diseases are also affecting food and nest trees (Johnstone and Kirkby 2019), an effect exacerbated by drought and heat waves (Matusick <em>et al</em>. 2018). Although the species has been fully protected since 1996 (Mawson and Johnstone 1997), illegal shooting by orchardists may still occur where they feed on apples and pears (Chapman 2007). Because the cockatoos can cause substantial economic damage (Halse 1986), efforts made to conserve the species historically have been less vigorous than for&#160;<em>Z. latirostris</em>&#160;(Ainsworth <em>et al.</em> 2016). The availability of freshwater for drinking may also limit numbers in dry years, given current trends in water availability in south-western waterways (<a name=""_Hlk46221803"">Barron <em>et al</em>. 2012</a>). Projections of heat (Herold <em>et al.</em> 2018), drought (Dey <em>et al</em>. 2019) and fire (Di Virgilio <em>et al</em>. 2019, Dowdy <em>et al.</em> 2019) all suggest future declines in forest food and sites with accessible drinking water.</span></p><p></p>"
"<p><span lang=""EN-AU"">Gang-gang Cockatoos are among the least studied species in the family in Australia, and there is inadequate understanding of the reasons they have been declining (Cameron 2007). Plausible threats include the loss of habitat through land clearing, particularly along the slopes of the Great Dividing Range, and a reduction in nest hollow availability due to forest management practices (NSW OEH 2020). For urban populations, clearing for housing can lead to the destruction of nest sites. Gang-gang Cockatoos breed mainly in mature forest (Loyn 1985) and decline with increasing removal of old trees (Loyn and Kennedy 2009). Fire poses a threat, destroying nest trees and suppressing seed production in key feed species (Koch 2003). Higher temperatures may also be having an effect (Herold <em>et al.</em> 2018), with heat waves implicated in the premature fledging of nestling Gang-gang Cockatoos (Cameron <em>et al</em>. 2021). <a name=""_Hlk63515081"">Extreme fire weather (Di Virgilio <em>et al. </em>2019, Dowdy <em>et al</em>. 2019) driven by longer and more severe droughts (Evans<em> et al.</em> 2017) and more frequent heat waves (Herold<em> et al.</em> 2018) are likely to increase in frequency and intensity in coming decades. </a>Given the broad-scale reduction in older-aged montane forests (Lindenmayer <em>et al.</em> 2015), and the time required for trees to form large hollows, it is plausible that hollow availability has declined across the range, probably leading to increased competition for hollows from other hollow-dependent birds, mammals and maybe European honey bees<em> Apis melifera</em> (Davey <em>et al.</em> 2019, M. Cameron unpublished, in Cameron <em>et al</em>. 2021). However, most threats are speculative.</p>"
"Forest on Biak has previously been badly impacted by logging and subsistence farming, particularly the southern plains (Bishop 1982, K.D. Bishop&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 1996, D. Holmes&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2000), though large-scale logging has not been economically feasible for some time (Wikramanayake&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002). The rate of forest cover loss recorded through satellite monitoring has been relatively slow in the past two decades, and over the past ten years the maximum rate is estimated at 3.8% (data from Global Forest Watch 2021, using Hansen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;[2013] data and methods disclosed therein). The species is tolerant of degraded forest and appears to persist within landscapes with a large proportion of small-scale agricultural gardens, hence the population impact of the past conversion of forest on Biak and Numfor is suspected to have been less than for a more specialised forest species. Much of Supiori comprises virtually impenetrable, forested limestone mountains, which is likely to be safe from habitat degradation.<br/>There is also a proposal for a spaceport on the eastern side of Biak, which would cause the loss of 6.5 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of Protection Forest (Perwitasari and Susanti 2019) and may result in further development (e.g. expanded and improved road infrastructure and increased settlement in the area): again, the impact on this species is unlikely to be as severe as for species more closely tied to intact forest.<br/>All&#160;<em>Micropsitta&#160;</em>are&#160;very difficult to keep alive in captivity and no member of the genus appears to have been successfully bred. It is accordingly&#160;less frequently targeted for capture for the bird trade than co-occurring parrots such as&#160;<em>Eos cyanogenia&#160;</em>or&#160;<em>Trichoglossus rosenbergi</em>,&#160;and this is not considered a significant threat for the species at present.<p></p>"
"<p><span lang=""EN-AU"">There is no obvious explanation for the population decline, although some threats to the Orange-bellied Parrot <em>N.&#160;chrysogaster</em> (DELWP 2016) may also apply to this species. In Tasmania, land clearing for agriculture continues to remove habitat given that up to 40&#160;ha can now be cleared without a permit (<a name=""_Hlk49435548"">FPA 2020</a>), nesting birds may be subject to excessive predation by introduced sugar gliders <em>Petaurus breviceps</em> (Stojanovic <em>et al</em>. 2014).<span lang=""EN-AU""> Cats <em>Felis catus</em> (<a name=""_Hlk49435570"">Woinarski <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2017</a>) and, on the mainland, foxes <em>Vulpes vulpes</em> may take some birds given they feed on the ground. Fire may have affected some birds as may drought, with both expected to increase in severity and frequency (<a name=""_Hlk49435604"">Evans <em>et al.</em> 2017, Di Virgilio <em>et al</em>. 2019, Dowdy <em>et al.</em> 2019</a>), which may also have contributed to declines. <a name=""_Hlk49618488"">Although droughts have probably reduced productivity of coastal saltmarsh and other habitats used in the non-breeding season</a>, recent fires may have attracted birds to breed in areas where they are less likely to be observed (Boon <em>et al.</em> 2011, Boon 2012). Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease may also have reduced survival and reproductive success (Raidal and Peters 2018).</span></p>"
"<p><span lang=""EN-AU"">The habitat requirements of <em>C. coxeni</em> are too poorly known to be certain about threats. While most clearing of lowland rainforest occurred over a century ago (TSSC 2016), it is thought to have created a temporal gap in food availability during the year (Coxen's Fig-Parrot Recovery Team 2001), particularly during drought when figs produce less fruit (Spencer <em>et al. </em>1996). Various land management practices, including grazing, prevent recruitment of isolated fig trees in paddocks and otherwise cleared land (Coxen's Fig-Parrot Recovery Team 2001).&#160;The lack of connections between habitat patches may provide a barrier to dispersal; the small population size and the fragmented state of the population and its habitat may make it difficult for birds to find sufficient food, particularly during winter; the lack of habitat may have increased the amount of competition between the fig-parrot and other species of birds; and the small population size (or, more specifically, the lack of social interaction) could inhibit birds from breeding (Coxen's Fig-Parrot Recovery Team 2001, Department of the Environment 2014). A predicted increase in the frequency or length of droughts (Evans <em>et al.</em> 2017) could affect food resources. Food supplies are also being reduced by cat's claw creeper <em>Dolichandra unguis-cati</em>, which smothers trees in riparian corridors (TSSC 2016). As no Coxen's Fig-Parrots are held in captivity, nests may be vulnerable to illegal egg or bird collectors (Holmes 1990).</p><p><br/></p>"
"<em></em>This species is threatened by on-going habitat destruction (Ekstrom 2013), assumed to be driven primarily by logging for timber and fuelwood (G. Rocamora <em>in litt</em>. 2014), as well as the encroachment of agriculture and the expansion of settlements."
"<p><span lang=""EN-AU"">Historically, clearance of habitat has reduced the range of <em>C. l. lathami</em>, particularly south and west of the Great Dividing Range and much of their core habitat of the forests in the Great Dividing Range has been affected by fire. These threats also are likely to have caused the extirpation of&#160;<em>C. l. halmaturinus&#160;</em>from the mainland (Joseph 1982).&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">While relatively few birds are likely to have been killed by the 2019Ã¢ÂÂ2020 fires, their food supply, already likely to have been diminished by drought (Cameron 2005, 2006b, 2009), will have depleted in burnt areas for at least a decade. Also, many nest hollows are sure to have been destroyed (Cameron 2009), especially in areas where the exceptionally dry conditions meant the largest trees in low parts of the landscape were destroyed. Any shortage of nesting hollows will increase competition from, for example, brushtail possums <em>Trichosurus </em>spp., which are responsible for high rates of nest failure of C<em>.&#160;l.&#160;halmaturinus</em> on Kangaroo Island (Garnett <em>et al</em>. 1999). The species also suffers from competition with introduced European honeybees <em>Apis mellifera </em>(Cameron <em>et al.</em> 2021). The regeneration of both allocasuarinas and potential future nest trees is impeded by grazing, either by stock or feral or native herbivores like rabbits <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>, goats <em>Capra hircus</em>, and deer (NSW TSSC 2004, Cameron 2005). Furthermore, any loss of suitable nesting hollows may take many decades to replace. In coastal areas, residential development increasingly impinges on cockatoo habitat, although some birds acclimatise and feed in remnant trees. Although Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease has not been detected in wild Glossy Black-Cockatoos, the risk of spread from other cockatoo species, particularly those that compete for nests, is high (Sarker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Climate change in the form of increasingly intense heat waves (Herold <em>et al.</em> 2018), drought (Evans<em> et al.</em> 2017) and extreme fire weather (Di Virgilo <em>et al.</em> 2019, Dowdy <em>et al.</em> 2019), which all act synergistically, is also likely to affect the species within the next three generations.</span></p><p></p>"
"Blyth (1996) proposed a list of threats considered realistic in the absence of direct evidence. Threats to the species are likely to vary across its range and might include predation by feral cats and foxes; soil disturbance, erosion and loss caused by herbivores (including livestock and over-abundant native and feral herbivores);&#160;degradation of habitat around water points by herbivores; competition for food by herbivores; fire;&#160;psittacine beak and feather disease, avian pox, and other diseases;&#160;illegal collection of birds or eggs;&#160;disturbance from bird-watching activities; fences; and reduction in water availability through over-use of waterholes by camels and&#160;reduced waterhole maintenance (TSSC 2016).&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">The sharp decline in reporting of Night Parrots after the 1880s is thought to have been caused primarily by a proliferation of cats (Ashby 1924, Whitlock 1924) but they are among the 20 Australian bird species most likely to be taken by foxes <em>Vulpes vulpes </em>(Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2021). However, fire and grazing are also likely to have been influential in their decline (Blyth 1996, Olsen 2018). The species has persisted where predation pressure from cats and possibly foxes <em>Vulpes vulpes</em> is thought to be low, spinifex cover is stable because appropriate fire regimes are maintained, and there are relatively productive patches in the landscape that have only had moderate grazing pressure from sheep, cattle and rabbits <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> (Murphy <em>et al.</em> 2018). Although well adapted to arid conditions, longer and hotter droughts could have a deleterious effect.&#160;Biophysical modelling suggests that predicted temperature increases under various climate change scenarios would increase the species' dependence on free-standing water dramatically (Kearney&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Thus, climate change, interacting with the spatial configuration of water points and habitats, and the concentration of feral predators at water points, may become a serious future threat.&#160;Concern that detection of the species on pastoral properties would have deleterious effects on subsequent management were generally misplaced (Garnett <em>et al</em>. 2016). <a name=""_Hlk68126184"">Improperly managed potash mining of salt lakes could reduce their suitability by affecting hydrology, fire or predation pressure.</a>"
"<p><span lang=""EN-AU"">The primary reason for the decline of the species has been because Indigenous traditional owners have been unable to fulfil their cultural obligations to Country. Traditional management has until recently largely been displaced by the grazing of cattle, often at densities that have led to a loss of the grasses the parrots require in the wet season and which provide fuel for fires that maintain an open structure in the woodlands. The altered vegetation structure would appear to have favoured parrot predators like Pied Butcherbirds <em>Cracticus nigrogularis</em> and disadvantaged woodswallows that serve as sentinels.&#160;Predation of adults is a major cause of nest failure, with almost one third of nests losing one or more adults. These effects have been compounded by the active removal of dingoes <em>Canis dingo</em>, a culturally important species, potentially leading to increases in the density of smaller predators, including cats <em>Felis catus</em> and perhaps goannas <em>Varanus</em> spp., as well as agile wallabies <em>Macropus agilis</em> and introduced pigs <em>Sus scrofa</em>, which destroy both wet season foods and knock over large termite mounds. Eventually, both termite mounds and parrots disappear from the landscape (Golden-shouldered Parrot Recovery Team 2019).</p>"
"This species appears little affected by the only introduced predator, Pacific rat <em>Rattus exulans </em>(Trevelyan 1995), but a larger rat species (e.g. <em>R. rattus </em>or&#160;<em>R. norvegicus</em>) or other alien predator is thought likely to cause greater damage (Bond <em>et al</em>. 2019a) as they have for other insular parrot species. In August 2011, a rat eradication operation was attempted on Henderson Island to eradicate <em>R. exulans </em>from the island&#160;but the attempt failed and rat density returned to pre-eradication levels by 2013 (Bond <em>et al</em>. 2019b). Introduced diseases such as avian malaria and pox are another potential threat. The introduction of exotic plant species could have serious consequences for the native vegetation (Waldren <em>et al.</em> 1995)<strong></strong> and therefore for this species.  <p></p>"
"The primary reason for the decline in population has been the removal of breeding and feeding habitat, initially in the wheatbelt used for breeding but more recently on the coastal plain which is largely used by non-breeding birds (Richards <em>et al.</em> 2020). Remaining wheatbelt habitat is fragmented, threatened by rising soil salinity, weed invasion, <em>Phytophthora cinnamomi</em> dieback, and fire (Saunders 1990; Saunders and Ingram 1998) with little regeneration of nest trees for &gt;60 years because of grazing by sheep and rabbits <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> (Saunders 1979; Saunders <em>et al. </em>1982, 2003, 2014b). Food plant productivity, fire regimes and nest recruitment are all likely to be less favourable as rainfall declines, temperature increases, and drought is more frequent and intense as the climate changes (P. Mawson unpublished, in Saunders <em>et al</em>. 2021). The availability of freshwater for drinking may also limit numbers in dry years, given current trends in water availability in south-western waterways (Barron <em>et al</em>. 2012). Galahs <em>Eolophus roseicapilla</em>, Little Corellas <em>Cacatua sanguinea </em>and introduced<em> </em>Long-billed Corella<em> Cacatua tenuirostris</em> and European honey bees <em>Apis mellifera</em> compete for remaining hollows (Johnstone and Kirkby 1999; Johnstone <em>et al</em>. 2010; Saunders and Doley 2019). Nest-robbing for the bird trade is now thought to be infrequent but has damaged nest hollows (Saunders et al. 1985; Mawson and Johnstone 1997). Most feeding habitat in the wheatbelt has either been cleared or is too distant from breeding habitat to be used when breeding (Saunders <em>et al.</em> 1985; Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Less has been cleared in the jarrah forest. While birds feed at rehabilitated bauxite mines eight years after rehabilitation (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2013) despite disturbance from forestry activities and mining, such areas lack nest hollows. Lowland, coastal plain habitat is under intense pressure, partly because urban development is removing banksia woodland and partly because most of the large Gnangara-Pinjar-Yanchep pine plantation, which has sustained non-breeding birds for several decades, has been reduced from 30,000 ha to 5,000&#160;ha (Stock <em>et al</em>. 2013; Johnston <em>et al</em>. 2020) and the remaining trees, which support 70% of the Perth-Peel population in winter, will be cleared by 2025 at the current clearance rate of 1000&#160;ha/year (A Peck unpublished). Other causes of death that may affect population trends include road-kills (Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2011), being shot by landholders for damaging nut crops (Pitman<em> et al</em>. 2007), hindlimb paralysis potentially caused by ingestion of organophosphates (Le SouÃÂ«f <em>et al.</em> 2020), heat waves, and hailstorms (Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2011). Given market prices and that captive birds have low rates of breeding success, illegal poaching also poses a threat to the species as eggs and nestlings are taken from the wild for use in avicultural markets (White 2011)."
"<p></p>The greatest potential threat to Princess Parrots is the spread of buffel grass <em>Cenchrus ciliaris</em> which increases fire spread and intensity, reducing the abundance of spinifex (Smyth <em>et al</em>. 2009) and damaging old hollow-bearing trees (Pavey <em>et al</em>. 2014), many of which are already senescent (Westerhuis <em>et al</em>. 2019).<em> </em>Their habitat may also have been degraded and food availability reduced by introduced rabbits <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> and camels<em> Camelus dromedarius</em> (Higgins 1999), and cats <em>Felis catus</em> could also be a threat to some individuals (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2017). Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease and poaching of eggs or young from nests are potential and minor threats, respectively (Carter 1993, Higgins 1999) but there is information on neither. Increasing heat may also affect the species given climate predictions for the region (Jacobs <em>et al</em>. 2013)."
"The accidental introduction of mammalian predators, such as rats <em>Rattus</em> spp., cats and mustelids <em>Mustela</em> spp., is the main potential threat to the species.&#160;Introduced mice have previously competed with the species for food, however have been controlled by eradication programmes (Horn<em> et al.</em> 2019).&#160;<span lang=""EN-NZ"">Known to hybridise with ReischekÃ¢ÂÂs parakeets in captivity, however there is no evidence for this in the wild.<span lang=""EN-NZ""><p></p></span>"
"The species disappeared from Mangere Island at the beginning of the 20th century owing to a combination of deforestation for pastoralism, decades of burning, the effects of introduced grazing mammals and predation by feral cats (Higgins 1999) however since the early 1970s has recovered as a result of habitat management and exotic predator control, as well as culling of Chatham Island red-fronted parakeets&#160;<em>Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae</em>. The threat of introduced predators remains a plausible threat. Hybridisation with&#160;Chatham Island red-fronted parakeets is an ongoing threat to the species which, despite culling, continues to establish itself in low numbers on Mangere Island (J. Kearvell <em>in litt.</em> 1999; T. Greene <em>in litt.</em> 2020)<strong></strong>. In 2006 it was estimated that over 50% of the birds with Forbes' parakeet morphology may be hybrids (Chan <em>et al.</em> 2006).&#160;The previously high rate of hybridisation is believed to be the result of the previously low population sizes of the two species (D. Houston and C. Miskelly <em>in litt</em>. 2008), but this has greatly decreased owing to positive assortative mating (T. Greene&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2012).&#160;A survey in 2011 assessed the phenotypes of concern to be at 10%, the trigger level for management action (D. Houston<em> in litt.</em> 2012). However, number of hybrids appear to have stabilised or declined since (T. Greene<em> in litt.</em> 2020). It is therefore thought that levels of hybridisation have remained below 10% of the total Mangere Island parakeet population for the past decade, and so no management intervention has been necessary. Currently the population of hybrid birds is monitored, and culls will resume if the number of hybrid birds on Mangere Island reaches 10% of the total number of parakeets on the island."
"Past declines have been attributed to deforestation, habitat modification and the introduction of mammalian predators, particularly cats, stoat <em>Mustela erminea</em> and rats (Heather and Robertson 1997, Higgins 1999)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. On offshore islands, Red-crowned Parakeet <em>C. novaezelandiae</em> is usually much more common (Heather and Robertson 1997)<strong></strong><strong><sup></sup></strong> and may have completely replaced <em>C. auriceps</em> on Solander Island. On Auckland Island, there is an unnaturally high rate of hybridisation between the two species. Beak and Feather Disease Virus (BFDV) has been identified from birds in the Eglinton Valley, Fiordland (Massaro <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;The species is thought to fluctuate as a result of beech-masting cycles which cause rapid predator increases (Robertson <em>et al.</em> 2021). As beech masting is triggered by comparatively warmer summers, more variable weather as a result of climate change is likely to exacerbate these effects.<p></p>"
"Historically, forest clearance and hunting decimated habitat and numbers (Heather and Robertson 1997, Moorhouse 1997, Greene and Fraser 1998, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong></strong>. Stoats <em>Mustela erminea</em> kill adults, in particular females incubating eggs, probably causing the highly skewed sex ratio on the mainland (Greene and Fraser 1998, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 1998, Ledgard 2010)<strong></strong>. Relatively large numbers of males can therefore remain highly visible for a long time after the population reaches a very poor condition functionally (Greene &amp; Fraser 1998,&#160;R. Hitchmough&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>. Common Brushtail Possums <em>Trichosurus vulpecula</em> rob nests, being responsible for the failure of six out of 13 nests in Whirinaki during a single breeding season (Greene <em>et al</em>. 2004)<strong></strong>, and compete for high-energy foods (especially native mistletoe) required for successful breeding (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 1998, Ledgard 2010, Heather and Robertson 2015)<strong></strong>. Brown Rats&#160;<em>Rattus norvegicus&#160;</em>are also implicated (Moorhouse 1997)<strong></strong>. Sites with predator control have a nest failure incidence of 16%, compared to 84% in sites without predator control (Moorhouse <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2003)<strong></strong>.

"<p></p>In 2002, all forest in New Ireland and West New Britain was allocated for industrial forestry, and New Britain alone accounted for approximately half of Papua New Guinea's timber exports (Bun <em>et al. </em>2004). Regulations on the frequency of re-logging areas are being ignored (Nelson<em> et al. </em>2014).&#160;<br/><br/>Many areas of lowland forest in New Britain have been converted to oil palm plantations (Swartzendruber 1993, Buchanan <em>et al.</em> 2008).

However, many of these areas appear to be unsuitable for oil palm, suggesting that they may be in place to facilitate commercial logging, under the pretext of oil palm development (Nelson <em>et al.</em> 2014, Bryan <em>et al</em>. 2015). Nevertheless, conversion to oil palm is likely to continue slowly in the region (Nelson <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/>Around 12% of forest cover in New Britain was lost between 1989 and 2000, with over 20% lost in the lowlands below 100 m (Buchanan<em> et al</em>. 2008). Since then, the rate of deforestation apparently slowed (B. Beehler <em>in litt.</em> 2016), and between 2002 and 2014, around 7.4% of forest on New Britain and 7.6% of forest on New Ireland was logged or cleared (Bryan <em>et al</em>. 2015). On New Ireland, most lowland forest was lost before 1989, and the area converted to oil palm has been much smaller (Davis <em>et al.</em> 2018)."
"It is threatened by logging and forest conversion, particularly for conversion to oil palm plantations. Around 12% of forest cover in New Britain was lost between 1989 and 2000 (Buchanan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Since then, the rate of deforestation apparently slowed (B.

Approximately 15 individuals were found on sale at a market in Kokopo, New Britain in 1996 (Wilkinson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2000) and 38&#160;wild individuals were imported to CITES signatory countries in 1996-1997 (Marsden <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001; WCMC CITES Database). However, very few imports of wild individuals were reported since 2000 (WCMC CITES Database) and extensive surveys in 1997-1998 and 2010 found no evidence of poaching (Davis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018)."
"Although the species is known to use a range of habitats, it may have suffered some negative effects from deforestation, which has been rapid. Overall, there was a reduction of undisturbed upland forest on Pohnpei of over 60% from 1975 to 1995 (Buden 1996, 2000; B. Raynor <em>in litt</em>. 1995, 2012; Oleiro and Kesler 2015). The majority of the island's forests have been to various degrees converted or at least degraded to mixed forest (native species mixed with lowland secondary species), largely attributable to the cultivation of sakau (= kava) <em>Piper methysticum</em> as a major cash-crop (B. Raynor <em>in litt. </em>2012). The fragmentation of such forest by sakau clearings also introduces and encourages the spread of invasive species in isolated areas throughout the forest. Although efforts over the past 20 years to reduce the amount of clear-cutting for sakau plantations have resulted in the slowing of native forest conversion rates, the trend remains negative (B. Raynor <em>in litt. </em>2012). There is a history of this species being hunted for food, persecuted for its perceived pest status and superstitious associations, and captured for trade, with the presence of some birds in captivity suggesting that nest poaching is still taking place (J. R. Gilardi<em> in litt</em>. 2010, 2011; M. O'Brien<em> in litt</em>. 2011)<strong></strong>. Its pest status may be exaggerated, as it apparently only inflicts minor damage on crops such as mangoes (Engbring <em>et al</em>. 1990)<strong></strong>. Climate change and sea level rise may impact this species in future by causing the loss and degradation of its mangrove habitat (Oleiro and Kesler 2015).&#160;<p></p>"
"The most important current threat is extensive and  intense fires that temporarily remove habitat and can  potentially extirpate isolated subpopulations, although  there is proven resilience to a range of fire regimes  (Baker <em>et al. </em>2010). In some places habitat rapidly  becomes suitable again after good rains: at Yuragir  National Park birds were present at two sites a year after  a severe fire in numbers similar to those detected before  the fire (M. Andren unpublished). Extreme fire weather  is likely to increase in frequency (Di Virgilio <em>et al.</em> 2019, Dowdy <em>et al.</em> 2019), driven by increases in the frequency  and severity of drought and heat waves (Evans <em>et al. </em> 2017, Herold <em>et al. </em>2018). Conversely, a lack of fire  leading to succession by tall shrubby vegetation appears  to have caused extirpation of the Otway Ranges population (G. Dutson unpublished). As a ground nester,  Ground Parrots may be susceptible to predation by cats  <em>Felis catus</em> and foxes <em>Vulpes vulpes</em>, particularly immediately after a fire (Lindenmayer <em>et al. </em>2009, Woinarski  <em>et al.</em> 2017). Most subpopulations are in relatively intact  protected areas but south of the Noosa River in Queensland, the cumulative effects of urban development,  stormwater run-off, sewage discharge and an unsuitable  fire regime is thought to be leading to a gradual replacement of the nutrient poor-heathland habitat needed by  the parrots with taller native and introduced weeds  (K.A. land unpublished). Also, relatively high rate of  hatching failure in the subpopulation in south-east Queensland  (McFarland 1991c) may be related to a particularly low  rate of genetic variability (Chan <em>et al.</em> 2008) but has not  been investigated."
"Extensive deforestation throughout its range is regarded as the principal cause of its rarity, and the north-east population is most threatened because sugarcane plantations have replaced virtually all lowland forest in Alagoas<strong> </strong>(Brown and Brown 1992, Conservation International <em>et al.</em> 1995). Only 12% of Atlantic Forest remains in the Pernambuco Centre of Endemism. Further south in Bahia, less than 10% of forest is intact, and in the rest of its range suitable habitat has been reduced to less than 20% of its original extent (Conservation International <em>et al.</em> 1995). Lowland forests were historically threatened by agricultural conversion and deforestation for mining and plantations (Fearnside 1996). Current key threats arise from urbanisation and agricultural expansion<strong> </strong>(Dinerstein <em>et al.</em> 1995, ICMBio 2018). The species is not sought-after as a cagebird, and while there may be some trapping going on its impacts are considered negligible (Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2014, Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><p></p>"
"In Australia, nest hollow availability appears to be the main constraint on abundance and is affected primarily by fire regime which both creates and destroys hollow and also affects the rate of spread of rainforest hollows are at a lower density (Heinsohn <em>et al</em>.&#160;2021). Hollow abundance is also affected by the clearance of woodland for bauxite mining (TSSC 2015), cyclones and competition with Sulphur-crested Cockatoos <em>Cacatua galerita</em>, which may have increased near Weipa (TSSC 2015). Elsewhere (in New Guinea), the chief threats are forest loss to make way for urban areas and plantations, as well as selective timber extraction. <br/>Trapping for pet trade is an ongoing threat and may accelerate as areas of forest become more accessible due to increasing road infrastructure. The impact of trapping for trade remains unquantified and poorly  understood, but both local (Pangau-Adam and Noske 2010) and  international (Sy 2010) trade of this species has been documented. Large  areas of the species' range in New Guinea, however, lie in areas  unlikely to be accessible to trappers. Nonetheless, this species breeds  extremely slowly (Igag <em>et al</em>. 2019) and any trapping,  especially of adults, is likely to have significant local impacts.  Locally, the species may be killed for food and/or ornamentation."
"The principal threat to this species is forest loss. Clearance for mining and oil-palm plantations are the most likely contributors (J. Eaton <em>in litt</em>. 2010, Eaton 2011) although remote sensing data (Global Forest Watch 2022) indicate that rates of loss have so far been slow and the island remains largely forested. Trapping for the cagebird trade may be a threat, although there is no evidence of this driving population declines (Symes <em>et al</em>. 2018)."
"Forest destruction in the Sundaic lowlands of Indonesia and Malaysia has been extensive, for timber and conversion to agriculture. In particular the rapid expansion of oil palm has driven the conversion of the majority of remaining lowland forest in the region. Declines are compounded by trapping for the cage-bird industry (Symes <em>et al</em>. 2018); however, the species' use of logged and fragmented forest, secondary growth, other modified areas and habitats at higher elevations implies that it has not suffered rapid declines.<br/><br/><p></p>"
The only recognised threat to this species is habitat loss and degradation which are projected to accelerate over the next decades and should be closely monitored (Voigt <em>et al</em>. 2021).<p></p>
"Forest loss is slow but ongoing within the range (per Global Forest Watch 2022); much of the lowland forest in its range has been or is scheduled to be logged. The cage-bird trade could threaten populations, although the severity of this threat is unclear.&#160;<p></p>"
Much of the lowland forest in the region has been or is scheduled to be logged but the montane forest is safe from such degradation.<p></p>
"The main threat comes from deforestation (less than 50% of Viti Levu remains forested), the resulting forest fragmentation, and the felling of large trees that are used for nesting (Juniper and Parr 1998)<strong></strong><strong><sup></sup></strong>. Over the last few decades, native forest was rapidly converted to mahogany plantations, causing significant loss of habitat for the species. This conversion has now largely ended however and forest loss appears to have stabilised at a lower rate, although&#160;concern remains over the impact of fragmentation of habitat with continuing forest clearance (Collar and Boesman 2020). There is some domestic traffic, but the ""red"" shining-parrots (<em>P. splendens</em> and <em>P. tabuensis</em>) are more important, with probably only one in ten shining-parrots in captivity being this species (D. Watling<em> in litt</em>. 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>"
"Forest on Kadavu was heavily logged in the late 1960s and early 1970s and habitat loss and degradation for agricultural purposes continues, though 75% of the island remains forested&#160;&#160;(Watling 2000, V. Masibalavu&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2007<strong></strong>). The species also uses degraded habitats&#160;such that although forest loss may affect the species, it may not be driving significant declines. Forest loss is slow but ongoing within the range (c.4-5% over three generations [Global Forest Watch 2022, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;[2013] and methods disclosed therein]).&#160;The growing human population on Kadavu and degradation of agricultural areas are increasing pressure to clear more forest (Conservational International Pacific Islands Program 2013).&#160;Forest fires are an additional threat (G. Dutson <em>in litt.</em> 2005), although conservation actions targeting forest fires have improved (M. Tabudravu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). Most river estuaries and bays still hold large areas of mangroves which are intensively used by <em>P. splendens</em> for feeding (and perhaps breeding), although pressure on mangrove forest is not significant at present (J. S. Kretzschmar<em> in litt</em>. 2000, D. Watling <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. It reportedly captured in small numbers, with birds being taken as gifts by islanders returning to the capital, Suva (Watling 2000)<strong></strong>, and there may be at least some illegal trade overseas (J. S. Kretzschmar<em> in litt</em>. 2000), although this is not considered to be a significant threat to the species (USFWS 2011).<p></p>"
"Its habitat is locally under threat from logging and clearance for agriculture; however, large areas of forest remain across much of its range, and the rugged terrain present in many areas affords ongoing protection against some anthropogenic processes (I. Woxvold <em>in litt. </em>2020). Reports of the species in Ok Tedi dropped dramatically following the severe drought in 1997-1998 (P. Gregory <em>in litt.</em> 2010), suggesting the species may be susceptible to climate-driven change in the availability of flower/nectar resources (I. Woxvold <em>in litt. </em>2020). Some populations may be impacted by mining activity at Ok Tedi in Papua New Guinea and at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, but the impacts of these developments are likely to be localised. The Ok Tedi open pit is mostly above the upper elevation limit reported for this species, and all or most Ok Tedi/Tabubil area records are from well below the pit site, but infrastructure and tailings from both mines may have localised influence on suitable habitat (I. Woxvold <em>in litt. </em>2020). It is probably tolerant of degraded and patchy forest. The species is not believed to be declining rapidly, and given (1) the large expanse of suitable remaining habitat, (2) the speciesÃ¢ÂÂ presumed nomadic habits, and (3) the lack of survey effort across much of its range, it is reasonable to conclude that the overall population remains secure (I. Woxvold<em> in litt. </em>2020)."
"The species is threatened by habitat destruction, fragmentation and degradation, largely through slash-and-burn conversion to agricultural small holdings and cattle grazing (Jacobs and Walker 1999). Parts of the range, particularly in Ecuador, are covered by mining concessions (M. SÃÂ¡nchez-Nivicela <em>in litt</em>. 2023). Its habitat in Peru is considered overall secure and not at imminent risk of deforestation, though forest loss and degradation are occurring at lower elevations (SERFOR 2018, B. Walker <em>in litt</em>. 2023).<br/><p></p>"

"Capture for the cagebird trade is the chief threat to this species throughout its range, having caused the near-extirpation of it from parts of its range (e.g. Lao PDR: Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press.). There are few empirical examples of the scale of this trade, although at a single site in Myanmar between December 2018 and April 2019,&#160;1,744 individuals were reported for sale from (Thin Thin Khaing 2019). It is also obscure what percentage of the trade in this species is international, although the appearance of birds in markets in Indonesia (not a range state) (Chng&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018) suggests that to some degree, birds are traded internationally. Although the species is listed in CITES Appendix II, there are very few trade records (CITES Trade Database 2023: all from Europe and likely refer to captively bred birds) suggesting that this mechanism is ineffective at monitoring trade currently. Habitat loss and degradation is considered a secondary threat. This species is very tolerant of habitat degradation and occurs, for example, in forest edge interspersed with cultivation (Juniper and Parr 1998). However, at least in South-East Asia, the species shows a strong affinity for lowland deciduous dipterocarp forests which have been subject to some of the most intensive habitat modifications in Indochina. Accordingly, habitat loss has locally likely contributed to some extent to declines; Timmins <em>et al</em>. (in press.) considered in Lao PDR that although habitat loss and degradation is unlikely to have been a proximate cause of population collapse, it ""could perhaps limit any future recovery if hunting is controlled""."
"By the 1980s the species was being extensively and unsustainably trapped for the cage-bird market, with an estimated 74,509 individuals exported from Indonesia between 1981 and 1990, and international imports averaging 9,751 per annum between 1983 and 1988 (BirdLife International 2001). Although reported international trade fell to zero in the 1990s, trappers have remained highly active and birds are openly sold within Indonesia (Metz and Nursahid 2004, Nandika <em>et al</em>. 2021)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.&#160;Illegal trade continued to be prolific during religious riots in 2004 (C. Shepherd <em>in litt</em>. 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and baseline estimates suggest 4,000 birds were removed from the wild annually in domestic trade alone. More recently, birds continue to be reported in international trade (Emerson <em>et al</em>. 2022, CITES Trade Database 2023) and are evidently still traded domestically (Nandika <em>et al</em>. 2021). However, current rates of trend are thought to be slower than those 20-30 years ago, with the protection of all Indonesian parrot species by law apparently having led to a reduction in the number of confiscations of this species (Nandika <em>et al</em>. 2021). Forest loss, degradation and fragmentation have likely compounded population declines over the past three generations, with rates of lowland forest loss increasing on Seram since 2014 (Global Forest Watch 2023) and projections anticipate even more rapid rates of forest loss in the future (Voigt <em>et al</em>. 2021). In addition to the obvious reduction in the extent of suitable habitat, selective logging and the removal of larger trees likely compounds long-term declines and population viability in this species, which depends on tree hollows for nesting."
"The main threat to this species is capture for the pet trade. Reportedly kept in villages and towns in large numbers on Seram itself and there is evidence from confiscations that it is exported nationally to other islands in Indonesia (e.g. Maulany&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021, Nandika&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021). Habitat loss and degradation are also key threats, driven principally by timber extraction and shifting agriculture/plantations.&#160;Annual rates of loss appear to be accelerating (Global Forest Watch 2024) and Seram's hill forests are considered vulnerable to exploitation in the coming decades (see Voigt <em>et al</em>. 2020). Over the past three generations (26 years: 1998-2023) forest cover in this species' range declined by c. 5%, a figure calculated using data from Global Forest Watch (2024) and Hansen <em>et al</em>. (2013), projecting back for two years (1998-1999) as data are available only from the year 2000. This does not account for additional impacts of degradation however, including selective logging removing hollow-bearing trees on which <em>L. domicella</em>&#160;is dependent on for nesting.<p></p>"
"The chief threats to this species are habitat loss and degradation, particularly that caused by shifting agriculture and plantations. Trapping is a (perhaps the main) threat to this species. The extent to which either of these is considered to be driving population declines is almost entirely unknown, but combined are suspected of driving ongoing population declines of 5-19% over three generations.<p></p>"
"Populations may be declining through habitat degradation, through logging, mining, fire and by introduced Rusa deer <em>Rusa timorensis </em>(Chartendrault and Barr<span lang=""EN-US"">ÃÂ©&#160;2005, 2006, Legault <em>et al</em>. 2012)<strong></strong>. Black rats occasionally prey on Horned Parakeet nests (Gula <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010), but the magnitude of their impact remains to be quantified. Particularly wet (La NiÃÂ±a)  years have been shown to reduce breeding success (J. Theuerkauf <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. in litt.</span> 2011). There are no important local traditions that encourage the possession of pet birds ((N. BarrÃÂ© <em>in litt.</em> 1999, Ekstrom <em>et al.</em> 2000, Chartendrault and BarrÃÂ© 2005, 2006), and there is&#160;little documented evidence of trapping or trade, although birds are occasionally held in captivity on the island, and the species is sought by collectors (Pain <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006). Poaching is unlikely to be a major threat, as the species breeds in remote areas, and its nests are hard to find. There is occasional illegal hunting (C. Meresse <em>in litt.</em> 2009). The introduction of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) also poses a potential threat&#160;<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">(Julian<em> et al.</em> 2012,&#160;Jackson <em>et al.</em> 2014).<p></p></span>"
"There is little information available on threats to this species, but ongoing habitat loss through agricultural expansion, logging for timber and development are thought to be causing a negative population trend. The threat of trapping is more abstract and difficult to quantify, but there is currently no evidence that this species is trapped at a scale or acuity capable of driving declines more than marginal."

"Subspecies pastinator declined significantly in range and numbers early in the 20th century, as it was considered an agricultural pest. Extensive shooting and poisoning by farmers caused the population to plummet to c.100 birds in the 1940s. However, both the expansion of agriculture and prohibition of poisoning and shooting has allowed a recovery in numbers (Garnett and Crowley 2000). Clearance for agriculture has reduced the area of breeding habitat for subspecies derbyi, and may be favouring the Short-billed Corella C. sanguinea. Nevertheless, despite a low reproductive rate, the range of this subspecies has expanded in recent decades (Garnett 1992)."

"Habitat clearance has rendered much marginal habitat in western Western Australia, southern South Australia and north-west Victoria unsuitable. However all records away from its core range, where there has been no habitat clearance, may be the result of ephemeral irruptions. Altered fire regimes may have a detrimental effect elsewhere but there is no evidence of decline in the last 20 years. Although provision of permanent water in semi-arid rangelands is said to have favoured Bourke's Parrot Neopsephotus bourkii over Neophema splendida, the two co-occur over most of the range of N. splendida (Garnett and Crowley 2000)."

"Clearance of woodland and mallee for agriculture destroyed much wheatbelt habitat, but now occurs at insignificant levels. Remaining habitat, however, is grazed which may be a potential threat. Nesting habitat has been destroyed, and regeneration prevented, by timber logging, firewood collection, ringbarking, increasing salinisation and waterlogging. In some areas, feral honeybees and Galah&#160;<em>Eolophus roseicapilla</em>&#160;compete for remaining available hollows. A small proportion of the population is exposed to poison, shooting, and when feeding on split grain, traffic accidents (Garnett and Crowley 2000)."
"The species range has contracted, probably as a result of overgrazing and inappropriate fire regimes. Disappearance from the coastal plains may be reversed by reinstating appropriate burning and grazing regimes. The species may occasionally be illegally taken for the bird trade, but this is unlikely to pose a serious threat as the species is common in captivity and easy to breed (Garnett and Crowley 2000)."

"Trapping for the cage-bird trade is a significant problem. Habitat loss has likely been a significant cause of declines over the past five decades, with almost all lowland forest on Luzon being cleared. While this species often visits degraded landscapes for foraging, it is probably dependent on relatively intact forests for breeding. Forest losses have been driven by a combination of shifting agriculture, local clearing of land, and much larger scale forestry. More recently, losses have been attritional and most likely caused by localised logging and land clearance; in some areas, this process has been allowed and expanded by the creation of new roads and tracks granting loggers (and trappers) access to hitherto remote forests. Preference for larger trees for selective logging may also have a disproportionate impact on this hollow-nesting species. There is also wholly unquantified evidence that this species in modified habitats may be being outcompeted/replaced by <em>Prioniturus discurus</em>.<p></p>"
"Forest destruction is the chief threat. Deforestation in lowland Palawan has been extensive, and logging and mining concessions cover most of the island's remaining forested areas. Illegal logging persists throughout the island, and typhoons represent a risk to remaining forest stands in protected areas. This species is apparently only short-lived in captivity and is probably not widely trapped (P. Widmann <em>in litt</em>. 2012); however it may be so locally. In some places persecuted for feeding on agricultural crops such as bananas.<p></p>"
"The species was formerly threatened by logging campaigns that resulted in the loss of much breeding habitat; however, this threat ended in the 1990s <strong></strong>(Zeidler and Francis 2011). Today, old-growth trees, some of which provide nest-holes, are still felled for house construction and firewood, even in protected forests <strong></strong>(Zeidler and Francis 2011). The species is subject to trapping pressure and egg-collecting for the pet trade <strong></strong>(MacKinnon and Phillipps 2000, J. Eaton <em>in litt</em>. 2010, Zeidler and Francis 2011, Praveen J. <em>et al. </em>2015). Egg-collecting and the subsequent incubation, rearing of birds and onward selling is very organised and may take place through a network of people in some areas <strong></strong>(Zeidler and Francis 2011). The species is openly sold and widely kept as a pet in its natural range <strong></strong>(J. Eaton <em>in litt</em>. 2010, J. Hornskov <em>in litt</em>. 2010, Zeidler and Francis 2011). It<em>&#160;</em>is present in both national bird markets, e.g. Guiyang, South-West China (Dai and Zhang 2017), as well as international markets e.g. in Algeria for $2044 per individual (Idir&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2023), in the West Bank, Palestine (Handal&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2023), in Singapore (Eaton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017) and Taiwan (J. Eaton&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2024). Whilst it is not entirely clear if these are wild caught or captive bred individuals, the implication that the species is considered highly valuable and sold both nationally and internationally persists. Despite this, the rate of decline is not thought to be rapid.&#160;In most cases only one to two individuals are being sold at a market.&#160;Additionally, the species is evidently commonest at remote high altitudes where there is minimal exploitation.<p></p>"
"<em>B. longicaudus</em> is a lowland specialist, dependent on intact mangroves and swamp forest (including peatswamp forest) for breeding (Collar <em>et al.&#160;</em>2020, Puan <em>et al</em>. 2020). The range of&#160;<em>B. longicaudus&#160;</em>has experienced a considerable loss of forest over the past several decades, including 38-45% loss in the three generations (21 years) to 2023 (Global Forest Watch 2024, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;[2013] and methods disclosed therein). This is similar to Symes&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2018), who predicted habitat loss to have contributed to a 33.8% decline over the next three generations (based on recent remote sensing data). Although the species&#160;occupies plantations, parks, and gardens sites (Jambari<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2012, Amit<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2014, Puan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020), forest loss is still likely to be an accurate predictor of population declines as the species breeds colonially in tree cavities found mostly in undisturbed forest (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020, Puan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020, Eaton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021).<br/><em><br/>B. longicaudus</em>&#160;is additionally threatened from the illegal pet trade, a widespread hobby across the speciesÃ¢ÂÂ range (Jepson and Ladle 2005). The species has been recorded in illegal trade markets from 1997 to 2001 in North Sumatra (Shepherd 2006), in South Sumatra in 2015 (Iqbal 2015), and Enganno Island in 2020 (Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). The species has even been noted in weekend markets in Thailand (Chng and Eaton 2016). The species is also subject to online bird trading (mainly private Facebook groups), which has provided enhanced reach for the trade in Indonesia (Iqbal 2015). An estimated 2,143 individuals were exported annually between 1986 and 1990, mostly from Malaysia (Collar <em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>Although plantations provide suitable feeding habitat for the&#160;<em>B. longicaudus</em>, they also present additional threat via hunting. The species may be perceived as an agricultural pest and consequentially shot or hunted&#160;(Iqbal <em>et al.</em> 2020)."
"The main threat to this species is forest loss. Over the past three generations (13.2 years: 2011-2024), forest cover loss in this species' geographic and elevational range decreased by&#160;<em>c</em>.3% (Global Forest Watch 2024, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods therein), although this does not account for additive impacts of selective logging and the removal of hollow-bearing trees on which this species depends for nesting. Its preference for montane forests, however, safeguards it from the more rapid reductions in forest extent and integrity in the Philippine lowlands. Trapping may be a threat to this species, although <em>Prioniturus </em>only infrequently turn up in trade and appear not to do well in captivity. As a montane species, climate change may affect it, although there is currently no evidence that direct or indirect affects on this species are occurring.<p></p>"
"The main threat to this species is forest loss.

"Logging previously reported to be in operation up to 500 m on the southern massif but unlikely to extend into montane forest (G. Dutson pers. obs 1997, Hornbuckle 1999)<strong></strong>. Remote sensing data&#160;(Global Forest Watch 2024, using data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein)&#160;indicate that forest loss is slow but ongoing: in the three generations (21.6 years) to 2023, 2-3% of forest cover was lost within the range, and since 2017 the rate appears to have accelerated (to a rate equivalent to&#160;<em>c.</em>4% in three generations). It is unclear whether this is driving population declines&#160;given that much of this species' elevational range lies above that affected by logging, however the apparent acceleration of forest loss in recent years suggest that operations may be expanding to higher elevations.<p></p>"
"The most prevalent threat to <em>P. alexandri </em>is the cage bird trade.&#160;Lowland species such as<em> P. alexandri</em> are also at increased risk from habitat loss as these areas are increasingly converted for cultivation, plantations, and timer crops (Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000). As the human population in Indonesia has increased, capturing of parrots for the domestic and international trade, as well as sport hunting, has increased in prevalence (Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000). The species is heavily traded across its entire range (Collar <em>et al.</em> 2020), and trade is heavily linked to declines in Indonesia (Snyder&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2000, Eaton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Collar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020), and Lao PDR (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, Timmins 2014, Collar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020, Timmins&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;in press). Specifically, the high export of the species from the Kangean Island has caused considerable declines in the population of the subspecies <em>kangeanensis</em>, and with cumulative impacts of habitat degradation, may result in the extinction of the endemic subspecies in the future (Berryman <em>et al.</em> 2024).<br/><br/>Additionally, although the species&#160;utilises secondary regrowth, as well as teak and coconut plantations, rural gardens, parks and urban areas (Juniper and Parr 1998, Neo 2012, Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020), forest loss and degradation is still likely to threaten the species by reducing nest site availability.&#160;The species nests in natural and excavated hollows (Juniper and Parr 1998, Namwong and Gale 2015), generally in taller, healthier trees (Namwong and Gale 2015), which are more abundant in remnant forest. The replacement rate of nesting trees lost by disturbance is likely slow. Observations of cavity excavation by any species was very rarely seen over five years of surveys of nesting birds in western Thailand, suggesting that cavity production is slow (Namwong and Gale 2015). The species largely uses cavities excavated by woodpeckers and barbets, so the nest site availability for <em>P. alexandri</em> will in part be dependent on the population trends of such species (Namwong and Gale 2015)."
"<p>The clearest threat to <em>H. finschii</em> is the pet trade, with reports of the species in trade markets from Myanmar (Khaing 2019), China (Zhang&#160;<em>in litt</em>.&#160;2013 in Khaing 2019), and Lao PDR (Khaing 2019). The clearest impacts of trade are in Lao PDR, where the species has all but disappeared from the north of the country (Fuchs&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2007, Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press). Although the species persists in northern and central Lao PDR, it is still a popular pet in these regions (Thewlis <em>et al</em>. 1998). The species also suffers from nest robbing and hunting for food in Lao PDR (Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press), but the extent of these threats, their prevalence elsewhere are unknown.&#160;</p><p>Although the impacts on the population are not fully understood, habitat loss and degradation are presumed to be impacting the species, considering the intensive nature of these threats within the speciesÃ¢ÂÂ range (Grantham&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2020, Theobald&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2020). Likely, the species will suffer declines as the density of suitable nesting trees are reduced from practices such as selective logging (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000), similar to <em>Psittacula alexandri</em> (Berryman <em>et al.</em> 2024).</p>"
"The two main threats to this species are habitat loss and degradation, as well as probably trapping for the pet trade. Over the past three generations forest loss has caused a reduction in tree cover of <em>c</em>.5-7% in this species' range (Global Forest Watch 2024, based on data from Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2013 and methods therein), which has largely been driven by local-scale shifting agriculture and clearance for plantations, almost entirely on Timor (Wetar has remained intact). The extent to which trapping affects wild populations is effectively unknown, but there is evidence for local (C. Trainor <em>in litt</em>. 2024), regional (e.g. Shepherd 2006) and international (Emerson <em>et al</em>. 2022, Donald <em>et al</em>. 2024) trade in this species.<p></p>"

"The primary threat to this species is accelerating rates of deforestation in the Amazon basin (Soares-Filho <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2006, Bird <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Proposed changes to the Brazilian Forest Code reduce the percentage of  land a private landowner is legally required to maintain as forest  (including, critically, a reduction in the width of forest buffers  alongside perennial steams) and include an amnesty for landowners who  deforested before July 2008 (who would subsequently be absolved of the  need to reforest illegally cleared land) (Bird <em>et al. </em>2011). Despite being common in undisturbed landscapes, it is not thought to be tolerant of secondary forest or agropastoral land and appears restricted to alluvial habitats. It may also be susceptible to hunting (A. Lees <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2011)."

"In the past, this species has been trapped in relatively large numbers for the cage-bird trade, both for domestic and overseas markets, with a total of 1,582 birds known to have been exported from Indonesia between 1985 and 1990 <strong></strong>(Beehler 1985, Nash 1990b, K. D. Bishop <em>in litt</em>. 1996, Collar 1997a), and 1,791 between 1990 and 2001 when recorded trade in the species ceased <strong></strong>(UNEP-WCMC 2007). However, the true scale of trade is unknown and it is probably overlooked by many trappers in preference of more sought-after and abundant species (B. Beehler <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). Local human population increases, resulting from transmigration (e.g. near Nabire and Jayapura), have increased logging and land clearance for agriculture <strong></strong>(R. Burrows <em>in litt.</em> 1994, Sujatnika <em>et al.</em> 1995), and have probably increased trade in the species. Additional threats to lowland forests within its range include many large-scale logging and agricultural schemes <strong></strong>(Sujatnika <em>et al.</em> 1995, K. D. Bishop <em>in litt</em>. 1996<em></em>). However, in Jalan Korea, where logging is  intensive, there are no  suggestions that this species is suffering a  population decline (M.  Halaouate <em>in litt</em>. 2013). In addition, recent information suggests that this species may be secure in the large  areas of inaccessible forest within its range: it was recently found to be  fairly common in the lowland forests along the Idenburg and Ruffaer  rivers and it is noted that large-scale oil palm  cultivation has not yet taken hold in the heart of the Mamberamo (B. Beehler <em>in litt</em>. 2012, D. Bishop <em>in litt</em>. 2012),<br/><br/><p></p>"

"Although there are reports that it is poorly tolerant of logged and degraded forest (Schodde 1977, Buckingham et al. 1995) and local extirpations may have occurred (Blaber 1990), it is frequently recorded elsewhere in logged forest (B.
