In the dry season of 1977, it was almost always observed in pairs, 10-20 m up in the few green trees and bushes (Willis and Oniki 1991)<strong></strong>. Birds occasionally also descended to the green cotton <em>Gossypium</em> bushes of a plantation (Willis and Oniki 1991)<strong></strong>. In both dry and gallery forests, it appears to prefer the upper branches of taller, emergent trees, where it sallies for insect prey (Raposo <em>et al</em>. 2002)<strong></strong>. Nest building has been observed in October (Kirwan <em>et al</em>. 2004, Albano 2009), and presumed incubation in November, with a fledgling in December (Albano 2009)<strong></strong>. It occurs at low densities and can be difficult to detect, even at known sites. Its ability to disperse is unknown; given that cerrado habitats are under threat and increasingly fragmented, it is likely that many populations are increasingly isolated. <p></p>","Its habitat is probably the most threatened in central Brazil owing to its valuable aroeira <em>Astronium urundeuva</em> wood and relatively fertile soils. Charcoal-burners were fully active at the type-locality in 1986, where there was also extensive forest cutting for pasture and agricultural development. The SÃ£o Francisco basin is also threatened by limestone quarrying and a large-scale irrigation project that has already resulted in the loss of large areas of forest (Raposo <em>et al</em>. 2002)<strong></strong><strong><sup></sup></strong>. Cattle ranching has resulted in forest clearance across large parts of the state of Minas Gerais within its range (Lopes <em>et al</em>. 2008). These same threats are impacting upon recently discovered locations and are exacerbated when remaining forest is highly fragmented<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span> (Lopes <em>et al</em>. 2008)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>","No empirical data is available, however, despite it apparent low population density and ongoing habitat degradation and fragmentation within the species's range, an extensive area of potentially suitable habitat remains that suggests the previous population estimate of 50-250 individuals needed revision. It is instead estimated to number 2,500-9,999 individuals, equating to 1,667-6,666 mature individuals, rounded here to 1,500-7,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Phylloscartes roquettei</em> is known from the SÃ£o Francisco and Jequitinhonha valleys, in north and central Minas Gerais, and in contiguous S Bahia and E GoÃ­as, in east-central <strong>Brazil</strong>. The type-specimen was collected in July 1926 near JanuÃ¡ria, now Brejo de Amparo, and birds were seen again in 1977 on both sides of the rio SÃ£o Francisco (Willis and Oniki 1991)<strong></strong>. Searches in 1985, 1986 and 1987 were unsuccessful, but the species was located at VÃ¡rzea da Palma, near Pirapora (c.190 km south of the type-locality) in 1993 and found to be very rare at the site in 1998, 1999, 2002 and 2005 (Raposo <em>et al</em>. 2002; Kirwan <em>et al</em>. 2004; Vasconcelos <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>.

An overlooked specimen taken in 1990 at the Fazenda Cana Brava along the rio Pardo Grande has recently come to light (Vasconcelos <em>et al</em>. 2008). It was recorded at the Projeto JaÃ­ba, Mocambinho in September 1996. Recent surveys discovered the species at several new localities along the SÃ£o Francisco river valley (Lopes <em>et al</em>. 2008) and from the Jequitinhonha river basin (Luiz <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. These new records increased the known extent of occurrence to 33,500 km<sup>2<strong>&#160;</strong></sup> (Lopes <em>et al</em>. 2008). Conjecture that the species may occur in contiguous habitat in south-west Bahia (de Vasconcelos <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong> was confirmed by dos Santos<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>.

There appears to be suitable habitat to the northeast and north-northwest of its current distribution (Marini <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). The population size has not been assessed; the only previous estimate was based on extrapolation across the known range at the time of just 50 km<sup>2</sup>, given the revised EOO the population is unlikely to be small.

Further declines are expected because suitable habitat is subject to extensive agricultural modification and afforestation. <p></p>","It inhabits wet grasslands near or within marshes. It apparently requires relatively tall grasses, mostly over 1-1.5 m (Pacheco and Gonzaga 1994, Di Giacomo and Di Giacomo 2004). Breeding occurs in the austral spring. It feeds on invertebrates. It was formerly partially migratory in north-east Argentina with birds reaching Buenos Aires province in the breeding season and Brazil during the winter, but remnant populations are resident (Di Giacomo and Di Giacomo 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In Paraguay it is sedentary, remaining even when grassland has been recently burned (H. del Castillo <em>in litt.</em> 2007). It has been observed following army ants <em>Labidus praedator </em>and armadillos <em>Euphractus sexcinctus</em> to forage for insects (Di Giacomo and Di Giacomo 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The mating system is complex (lek-like), involving breeding groups with monogamous and polygamous males that can be maintained for more than 10 years (A. S. Di Giacomo and A. G. Di Giacomo <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. It is gregarious, commonly being found in groups of 20 and exceptionally up to 50 birds (H. del Castillo <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>","Agricultural conversion and over cattle-grazing of natural grasslands are the principal threats to remaining populations in Argentina (Di Giacomo and Krapovickas 2002, Clay <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> in prep.). Early declines in the Pampas of Argentina were caused by the spread of&#160; corn, wheat and soybean monocultures (<strong></strong>Di Giacomo and Di Giacomo 2004)<strong></strong>. Later declines in the central Chaco of Argentina were caused by the establishment of cotton crops (<strong></strong>Di Giacomo and Di Giacomo 2004)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. In Corrientes and Formosa, cattle ranching has not caused critical modifications of natural grasslands. However, spring and summer fires for improving pastures affects reproductive success in Corrientes (A. S. Di Giacomo and A. G. Di Giacomo <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Other short-term threats come from the spread of soybean and rice crops, and pine and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Eucalyptus </span>plantations in some traditional cattle ranching areas (<strong></strong>Di Giacomo and Di Giacomo 2004)<strong></strong>. In Corrientes, afforestation with <em>Eucalyptus</em> and <em>Pinus</em> spp., encouraged by government incentives (Di Giacomo and Krapovickas 2002, Clay <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> in prep.)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, is even affecting wet valley bottoms since trees are often planted adjacent to, or within, inundated grasslands, regardless of their subsequent poor growth and unsuitability for the market (R. Davies verbally 1998)<strong></strong>. In Paraguay the main threats are loss of grassland habitats for afforestation with <em>Eucalyptus</em>, cattle ranching and the introduction of invasive grasses, and excessive burning. Conversion of wetlands and grasslands for rice fields is a rapidly increasing threat in Eastern Paraguay (H. del Castillo <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Its preference for tall grasses makes it intolerant of even biannual burning (Di Giacomo <em>et al.</em> 2011). Pesticides, fertilisers and other chemicals are widely used<strong><sup> </sup></strong>and must have profound effects on suitable grasslands (Clay <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> in prep.)<strong></strong>. It is apparently not disturbed by extensive cattle ranching (H. del Castillo <em>in litt.</em> 2007). <p></p>","The population is estimated to number 10,000-19,999 individuals based on an assessment of known records, descriptions of abundance and range size. This is consistent with recorded population density estimates for congeners or close relatives with a similar body size (the lower limit of such estimates for tyrannids is one individual/km<sup>2</sup>), and the fact that only a proportion of the estimated Extent of Occurrence is likely to be occupied. This estimate equates to 6,667-13,333 mature individuals, rounded to 6,000-15,000 mature individuals here.",Decreasing,"<em>Alectrurus risora</em> now occurs primarily in south <strong>Paraguay</strong> (Presidente Hayes, Amambay, Central, Cordillera, Alto ParanÃ¡, ParaguarÃ­, GuairÃ¡, Misiones, ItapÃºa and San Pedro) and north <strong>Argentina</strong> (Di Giacomo and Di Giacomo 2004) (Corrientes, eastern Formosa, and rarely in Chaco and Misiones). There has perhaps been a catastrophic loss of range in <strong>Brazil</strong>, the last record coming from Rio de Janeiro in 1974 (Pearman and Abadie 1995<strong></strong>), with older records from Mato Grosso, SÃ£o Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul; <strong>Uruguay</strong>, where it was formerly an uncommon breeder, but has only yielded one unconfirmed record since 1986 (A. B. Azpiroz <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1999<strong></strong>), and Argentina (Santiago del Estero, Santa Fe, Entre RÃ­os, CÃ³rdoba, San Luis and Buenos Aires). In 1993, the population in Corrientes was estimated at c.23,000 birds, but recent records indicate that numbers in Chaco and Formosa are considerably lower (di Giacomo and di Giacomo 2004).

Previous very rapid rates of habitat loss have slowed dramatically, but many remaining forest patches are now small and continue to be degraded. With subpopulations that exceed 1,000 mature individuals the species does not meet thresholds for listing as threatened, but is assessed as Near Threatened. Securing the future of remaining forest patches and working to restore habitat connectivity will reduce extinction risk in the species.<p></p>","It inhabits lowland humid and semi-humid forest, forest borders, secondary forest, adjacent clearings and occasionally cocoa plantations (Ridgely and Greenfield 2001, Freile and Restall 2018, Hilty 2021). The diet consists of fruit and arthropods, especially spiders, although vertebrates (frogs and lizards) made up nearly half of the food fed to nestlings (Greeney 2006). Breeding is thought to occur in the wet season, between January and March (Walther 2020), and a nest has been found in February (Greeney 2006). Most records are from below 1,000 m (GBIF 2023) with the typical upper elevation given as 1,400 m (Walther 2020) though it has been recorded up to 2,400 m (Ridgely and Greenfield 2001).<p></p>","Below 900 m, the rate of deforestation in west Ecuador in 1958-1988 was 57% per decade (Dodson and Gentry 1991)<strong></strong>.  Habitat loss continues, at least in unprotected areas of both Ecuador  and Peru, albeit at a much slower rate, and most remaining lowland  forests are in various stages of degradation (Dodson and Gentry 1991, Global Forest Watch 2023). As a result the species appears to have become extinct across moderately large areas surrounding Guayaquil since the 1980s, while further sites with recorded occurrences also appear to have lost the species (eBird 2024). Between 2-4% of forest cover is estimated to have been lost within the range over the past three generations (Global Forest Watch 2023, using Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2013] data and methods disclosed therein), but many areas are now small and degraded fragments. Forests in higher parts of the species' range are suffering from less disturbance, but are likewise under pressure from logging and conversion of land for agriculture and plantations (Dodson and Gentry 1991) and the species appears to favour lower elevations (GBIF 2023). <br/>Disturbance and degradation of remaining forest patches through grazing by goats and cattle&#160;also poses a threat, particularly in deciduous forests. Even protected areas are affected by illegal settling, logging  and livestock-grazing.<br/><p></p>","The species is described as uncommon (Freile and Restall 2018, Walther 2020, Hilty 2021); it appears to occur patchily within its range (eBird 2024). Using a density (based on surveys of territorial individuals) of 3.1 mature individuals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and assuming that it is present in only 10% of the modelled area of suitable habitat, 17,152 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(M. SÃ¡nchez Nivicela&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2024), an indicative precautionary population size is around 5,300 mature individuals. The national population size in Colombia is estimated at 2,747 mature individuals (Renjifo&#160;<em>et</em>&#160;<em>al</em>. 2014), based on an occupied habitat area of 886 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;out of 3,240 km<sup>2</sup> apparently suitable habitat (27%) and the same density. Using this proportion of occupied habitat increases the overall preliminary population size to 14,400 mature individuals, such that a preliminary suggested population size falls between 5,000-15,000 mature individuals.&#160;&#160;<br/>The population is inferred to be declining due to ongoing slow forest loss and additive impacts of fragmentation and continued degradation of remaining forest after very rapid deforestation last century (Dodson and Gentry 1991). A suspected rate of reduction exceeding 30% was applied to the Colombian population based on 18% habitat loss between 2000-2010, with the additional loss suspected due to the impact of very small-scale but relevant clearance not being detected (Renjifo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).",Decreasing,"<em>Attila torridus</em> occurs from extreme southwest Colombia (NariÃ±o) through west Ecuador to extreme northwest Peru (Tumbes).<br/>A modelling approach estimated a lower area of habitat at 17,152 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(M. SÃ¡nchez Nivicela&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2024). A value provided for area of occupancy (AOO) based solely on recorded presences is reported as 1,512 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;but assumes the species is absent from all intervening but apparently suitable habitat, despite limited survey effort. Consequently it is not plausible that the lower bound of the AOO falls below 2,000 km<sup>2</sup> (the threshold for listing as threatened under Criterion B2). However, it is clear that the species is not evenly distributed through forest habitat within the range and rather occurs patchily, such that an AOO value very likely falls below the area of habitat estimated. Rapid habitat loss has seen the species apparently become extinct across moderately large areas surrounding Guayaquil since the 1980s (eBird 2024). Forest cover loss is continuing at a slow rate, but many areas are now small and degraded fragments. Accordingly, it is inferred that the AOO is continuing to decline.&#160;<br/>Forest cover in this area, taken as a proxy for habitat loss, reduced by between 2-4% between 2012-2022 (Global Forest Watch 2023, using Hansen<em> et al.</em> [2013] data and methods disclosed therein). <br/>At least two subpopulations are assumed to be present based on the clustered distribution of records, although intervening areas are poorly sampled (eBird 2024).<br/>National assessments of the species for Colombia and Peru (Renjifo <em>et al. </em>2014, SERFOR<em>&#160;</em>2018) estimate respectively 3,240 km<sup>2</sup> and 791 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of suitable habitat are present in those countries, with an AOO for Colombia estimated at 886 km<sup>2</sup>(Renjifo <em>et al. </em>2014).<p></p>",This species was not recorded in any of the trade databases reviewed by Donald<em> et al.</em> (2024) and there is no indication that the species is traded or otherwise used.,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species occurs in  several protected areas, including Machalilla National Park, Ecuador, and Northwest Peru Biosphere Reserve, Peru<strong></strong>.

Seasonal altitudinal movements are suspected, which might explain the lack of post-1996 records in the Serra dos ÃrgÃ£os. This tiny, inconspicuous species is probably easily overlooked, perching in the canopy where it actively explores clumps of bromeliads, apparently avoiding treetops.

Rates of forest loss within the range indicate that the species's population size is likely to be undergoing a decline. It is therefore classified as Near Threatened.<p></p>","The species is found in montane Atlantic forest. In the Mantiqueira mountains in Brazil, the species inhabits&#160;<em>Araucaria angustifolia</em>&#160;forest, but it has also been recorded in low forests without dominant&#160;<em>A</em><em>raucaria&#160;</em><em>angustifolia </em>in Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. In Argentina, it appears to be associated with&#160;<em>Ocotea pulchella </em>forest on slopes around streams, with&#160;<em>Araucaria angustifolia&#160;</em>only sometimes also present&#160;(Bodrati <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Here,&#160;<em>Piprites pileata&#160;</em>was recorded in areas with a higher density of&#160;<em>Ocotea pulchella&#160;</em>trees (Bodrani <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). It has also been recorded in forest edges and logged forest (Vasconcelos and D'Angelo-Neto 2009, Bodrati <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Observations in Itatiaia National Park suggest that it may be an altitudinal migrant (A. Whittaker&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 1999). If true, it may require continuous tracts of forest within its altitudinal range of 900-2,000 m in Brazil. In Argentina, it has been found from 500 to 600 m. There, it does not migrate, as individuals were observed year-round at the same sites in Caa Yari Provincial Park and GuaranÃ­ Multiple Use Reserve<strong>&#160;</strong>(Bodrati&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Pairs or single birds forage in the canopy and subcanopy of dense forest, sometimes accompanying mixed-species flocks when these pass through their territories<strong>&#160;</strong>(Bodrati&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, de Vasconcelos and Neto 2009). The diet consists of arthropods, especially larvae<strong>&#160;</strong>(Bodrati&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009), and fruit. Pairs were seen displaying from September to November, and a nest was under construction in October<strong>&#160;</strong>(Cockle&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, Bodrati&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).","Loss of Atlantic forest has been extensive, although montane forests have suffered considerably less destruction than adjacent lowland forests.&#160;<em>Araucaria </em>forests have been much reduced in extent. In ParanÃ¡, the area covered by <em>Araucaria </em>forests declined from an original 74,000 km<sup>2</sup> to 16,000 km<sup>2</sup> by 1965<strong> </strong>(Hueck 1978). Development for ecotourism is causing forest loss in the Mantiqueira mountains, and forest is also cleared for plantations of potatoes, carrots, and trees such as <em>Araucaria, Pinus</em>, and <em>Eucalyptus</em>&#160;(Vasconcelos and D'Angelo-Neto 2009). The population in Argentina is very small and localized, and is not subject to any specific protection, and thus is vulnerable to forest disturbance including selective logging, forest clearing for agriculture, and accidental forest fires (Bodrati <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). The impact of logging in the&#160;<em>Ocotea pulchella </em>forest is not known, but it may promote invasion of other tree species, leading to habitat degradation for <em>P. pileata </em>(Bodrati <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).<br/><p></p>","There is no direct data on population densities, but the species appears to be rare and very sparsely distributed. In Argentina, searches in forest remnants across central and northern Misiones over five years only detected the species at six sites (Bodrati <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).<br/><br/>Based on the lower density estimates for the closely-related species <em>P. chloris</em>&#160;(0.5-1.6 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>; Thiollay 1986, 1992), the approximate area of tree cover with at least 50% canopy cover within the species's range in 2010 (84,000 km<sup>2</sup>; Global Forest Watch 2020), and assuming 10-25% of the tree cover within the range is occupied, the population size is tentatively suspected to fall between 4,200 and 33,600 individuals, which is assumed to roughly equate to 2,800 - 22,400 mature individuals.<br/><br/>The subpopulation structure is poorly known, but assuming the population size falls towards the lower end of the range, and that there are at least several subpopulations, the largest subpopulation is suspected to have fewer than 1,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Piprites pileata</em> occurs in south-east <strong>Brazil</strong>, and <strong>Argentina</strong>.

It occurs in savanna with scattered shrubs, tall grass in <em>cerrado</em>, and low heath-like shrubs and tall grass (Fitzpatrick and Sharpe 2020). It is rarely recorded in disturbed vegetation, although several individuals have been recorded in savanna within an oil palm plantation (Ruiz-Ovalle and Chaparro-Herrera 2016). It feeds on insects (Collar and Wege 1995).","Conversion to agriculture for <em>Eucalyptus</em> plantations, arable agriculture (largely soybeans, maize and rice) and pastures have had a severe impact on its habitat in Brazil (Parker and Willis 1997)<strong></strong>, where two-thirds of cerrado were heavily or moderately altered by 1993 (<strong></strong>Conservation International 1999)<strong></strong>, with most destruction having occurred since the 1950s (Cavalcanti 1999)<strong></strong>. In Rio Grande do Sul, 15.6% of native grasslands were lost over 27 years from 1976-2002 (Cordeiro and Hasenack 2009). The main ongoing cause of habitat conversion in Brazil is forestry, with developments for mining, hydroelectricity, roads, commercial premises and tourism also contributing (Urben-Filho and Costa Straube 2008, ICMBio 2013).&#160;In Argentina and Paraguay, grasslands have been converted to sown pastures for cattle ranching, and to arable agriculture&#160;(mainly soybean, sunflower, maize, wheat and rice) and tree plantations (pine and eucalyptus; Pearman and Abadie 1995, Lowen <em>et al.</em> 1996). Between 1985-1989 and 2002-2004, grassland cover within the&#160;RÃ­o de la Plata grassland region decreased from 67.4 to 61.4% and the area of agriculture increased from 22 to 25.9%, with declines in grassland being higher in Argentina, and some areas of flat pampas dominated by arable plantations (Baldi and Paruelo 2008). In western Uruguay, grasslands have been converted to plantations of soybean, wheat and corn (Paruelo <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). In Colombia, large areas of the Orinoco region have been converted to agriculture, and savannas have been converted to pastures and plantations of oil palm and crops, with a subsequent increase in the frequency of fires (Amaya-Villarreal 2016). The species's strict habitat requirements render it vulnerable to habitat degradation through overgrazing and fire. Conversion of land to oil palm plantations could pose a future threat (LÃ³pez-Ricaurte <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).","Although widespread and fairly common at a few localities, it is generally scarce and localised (Collar and Wege 1995, Parker and Willis 1997). Surveys in the Argentinian Pampas in 2006 to 2008 found the species to be rare, with records in only two of 30 transects (Codesido&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).<br/><br/>The global population size has not been quantified, but given the size of its range, it is assumed to be larger than 10,000 mature individuals (Collar and Wege 1995). The population in Argentina is suspected to number 2,500-10,000 mature individuals (MAyDS and Aves Argentinas 2017).

Even though habitat  degradation is ongoing slowly the species shows some resilience and  there is no evidence of declines.<p></p>,"It inhabits scrub, woodland and gardens. The diet is insects and small fruit, particularly those of the endemic tree <em>Ficus noronhae<strong></strong></em><strong> </strong>(Antas <em>et al.</em> 1990). Reproduction occurs throughout the year, with a peak during March to May (L. Mestre <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The nest is constructed with the tendrils of <em>Cucurbitaceae</em> and a few twigs, and located in the bare branches of a <em>Burra</em>, <em>Erythrina</em> or cashew-nut tree<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Oren 1982<strong></strong>). <p></p>","Its absence from cleared areas suggests that this species was presumably  historically more widespread, as the island was reportedly covered in  forest when discovered in 1503 (Olson 1994). All large trees have long  since been cut and all remaining vegetation on the island is secondary  (Olson 1994). However, this appears to have had little effect on the  viability of the population, even though the species' preference for and  higher abundance in well-conserved areas and natural vegetation  suggests that there may be some sensitivity to human disturbance (Mestre  <em>et al</em>. 2016). Habitat loss and degradation is however still  ongoing slowly; the main driver being touristic infrastructure  developments (Mestre <em>et al</em>. 2016). Cats and rats were introduced to the island in the 19th century, though likely even much earlier (A. Schulz Neto <em>in litt.</em> 1999, Russell <em>et al</em>. 2018); their continued presence on the island suggests that possible predation is unlikely to impact on Noronha Elaenia.<p></p>","The species is described as the least common of the three resident landbirds on Fernando de Noronha (Hosner 2020, see also eBird 2023).

As a result, it is listed as Vulnerable.","This species favours thorny desert, xerophytic steppes and mesquite savannas; open thorn-woodland dominated by mesquite <em>Prosopis</em> and acacia <em>Acacia</em> where trees are widely separated by sparse ground cover of grasses and herbs. It will occur in agriculture reserves and other modified/planted habitats such as hedgerows and patches between fields (C. Devenish in litt. 2012), and is occasionally found in isolated <em>Prosopis</em> groves (where it was formerly more common) (R. Ridgely and F. Angulo in litt. 2007) in otherwise barren desert. The species was found to be positively associated with larger tree girths, especially <em>Prosopis</em> (Devenish and Piana 2019, Devenish <em>et al</em>. 2020), possibly due to the availability of nesting cavities. Nesting has been recorded in DecemberâMay, but northern populations may breed later than southern ones. The species has been recorded up to 500 m, but is typically found below 350 m.","Human population density has increased considerably in the past three decades. There has been an expansion of large plantations of export crops within its range (including mango, grapes and sugar cane) and in some cases suitable habitat has been destroyed (C. Devenish in litt. 2012). A particular concern are the large-scale irrigation schemes that pipe water from the Amazon basin through the Andes to supply export agriculture on the coast. Large areas of desert scrub are cleared for these areas, such as 370 kmÂ² near Olmos in 2013â2016 (Devenish and Piana 2019, Devenish <em>et al</em>. 2020). Goat density has increased concomitantly and grazing pressure threatens dry scrub and wooded habitats. Daily collection of firewood by the many households in the region, cutting both live trees and dead, is causing a gradual reduction in the extent and density of scrub and woodland (R. Ridgely and F. Angulo in litt. 2007). At Chaparri, community residents are specifically prohibited from cutting live wood, which is placing additional pressure on the continuing existence of dead limbs and snags; nesting in cavities and recesses, Rufous Flycatchers may well thereby be put under additional pressure through the loss of nest sites (R. Ridgely and F. Angulo in litt. 2007). Bee-keeping for honey production has been encouraged for the last several decades through various aid programmes. The larger tyrant flycatchers of the region have reportedly become habitual predators of the bees around the hives, and local people apparently try to kill them (with slingshots) at any opportunity. All such larger flycatchers have declined markedly in most areas, including especially the Rufous Flycatcher (R. Ridgely and F. Angulo in litt. 2007).","The species's density in suitable habitat is estimated at six individuals per kmÂ² (range 1.9â44.6 individuals per kmÂ²) at occurrence sites (Devenish <em>et al</em>. 2020). Given the overall low density of the species over a large area, the population size is estimated at 11,500 individuals in total (Devenish <em>et al</em>. 2020), which roughly equates to 7,700 mature individuals. However, considering the conservative approach of the population estimate, the true population size might be much larger. Therefore, the population size is here tentatively placed in the band of 2,500 to 9,999 mature individuals. It is suspected that all individuals are part of the same subpopulation (Devenish <em>et al</em>. 2020).",Decreasing,"<em>Myiarchus semirufus</em> is endemic to the Tumbesian lowlands of <strong>Peru</strong>. It has a wide distribution across the northwest of the country, ranging from Tumbes to Ancash, albeit at low densities. Recent records are mainly spread across Piura and Lambayeque, including near the border with Ecuador in Lancones (Devenish <em>et al</em>. 2020). Formerly, the species occurred slightly further south along the strip of lowlands between the coast and the Andes, to the Ria Pativilca <em>ca</em> 200 km north of Lima. It is possible that the species's range has contracted northwards, with no records from Lima Department for many years. However, the species has been recorded recently in La Libertand (Mocan, near PaijÃ¡n, CaÃ±oncillo) and Ancash (Monte Zarumo) in systematic surveys (Devenish <em>et al</em>. 2017, 2020), and possibly the apparent decline in southern parts of the range was due to a lack of data (C. Devenish in litt. 2020). The species has also been recorded at NepeÃ±a and PaÃ±amarca north of Casma, Ancash Department in 2004. All other recent records are derived from Olmos, Mocupe, Rafan, the Rio ZaÃ±a, Apurlec, Chaparri and Bosque de PÃ³mac near Chiclayo, (Lambayeque Department), Sechura, Chulucanas, Talara, El Angolo and the Bayovar/Illescas Peninsula, Islilla, Puerta Pulache, Pampa Larga, Ãapique and Lancones (Piura Department; I. Franke in litt. 2007, P. Hosner in litt. 2007, S. Mahood in litt. 2007, T. Mischler in litt. 2007,  D. G. Olaechea in litt. 2007, R. Ridgely and F. Angulo in litt. 2007, R. Williams in litt. 2007, Barrio <em>et al</em>. 2015, Angulo and SÃ¡nchez 2016, Devenish <em>et al</em>. 2017, 2020).<br/><br/>It is very likely that the species has declined and experienced a slight range contraction. It now appears to be genuinely patchy in its distribution, but there is almost certainly a bias in observer effort, with most birdwatchers visiting the same sites. More widespread effort in the comparatively large areas of potentially suitable habitat north and south of the known localities may reveal that the species remains more widespread and common than current evidence suggests.",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species is protected in the Santuario HistÃ³rico Bosque de PÃ³mac and Coto de Caza El Angolo (Barrio <em>et al</em>. 2015, Angulo and SÃ¡nchez 2016, Devenish and Piana 2019). Surveys across the species's range were carried out in 2012â2013; they included a habitat and threat analysis (Devenish <em>et al</em>. 2017, 2020). A Zona Reservada (possible future national protected area) has been declared at the Illescas Peninsula, where the species is present (Devenish <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Survey more widely within the species historical range to determine current distribution and reassess its threat status, especially in Piura and Lambayeque (C. Devenish in litt. 2020). Advocate that areas of <em>Prosopis</em> and <em>Acacia</em> woodland are protected and grazing by goats and fuelwood collection be prohibited. Raise awareness over the species's status and encourage bee-keepers not to kill flycatchers. Research its natural history (F. Angulo in litt. 2012). Develop landscape-scale conservation mechanisms with farming communities, including the exclusion of goat grazing on a rotational basis, the establishment of zones for dead wood collection, and the establishment of small forest patches among agricultural land (C. Devenish in litt. 2020).",Neotropical,,FALSE,FALSE,Global,5749.0,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,AVIBASE-65D6284F,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,24.1,15.9,7.3,5.3,21.6,87.8,10.8,76.9,12.4,87.5,22.5,Dunning,,NO,,,Shrubland,2.0,1.0,Carnivore,Invertivore,Insessorial,-9.55,-4.03,-5.55,-80.42,3794.35
