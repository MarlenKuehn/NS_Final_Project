It was widely trapped as early as the 19th century. In 1999, research suggested that as many as 1,000-2,000 birds were being taken from Karakelang each year, 80% (illegally) to the Philippines. This is compounded by the extensive loss of forest, perhaps the main factor underlying its disappearance from Sangihe. The reasons behind habitat loss are small-holder agricultural encroachment into primary forest and (illegal) commercial logging. Furthermore, in 2003 there were plans to develop a commercial banana plantation on Karakelang <strong></strong>(Riley 2003).

They have also been observed to consume invertebrates, leaves, flowers, nectar, bark, lichen, resin and soil (Warburton 2003, Warburton and Perrin 2005b)<strong></strong>. The crop-ripening season coincides with the species's breeding season<strong> </strong>(Warburton 2003, Warburton and Perrin 2005d) and its appetite for crop seeds has earned it a reputation locally as a pest<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. In south-west Zambia, it has been recorded that 18% of millet seed heads suffered more than 20% damage from the species during the ripening season (Warburton 2003)<strong></strong>. Flocks were observed feeding in sorghum and millet fields in early 2012, mainly east of the Machile River (N.

S. Warburton <em>in litt.</em> 1999, 2000]<strong></strong>), with maize, between c.1930 and 1950 (Dodman 1995c, Dodman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2000)<strong></strong>. There is evidence that the wild-caught trade in this species is currently at a very low level, with only isolated incidences of trade and export (Dodman 1995c, Warburton and Perrin 2005c)<strong></strong>, although it is clear that any international demand would be met eagerly<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Warburton and Perrin 2005a, d)<strong></strong>. Some birds are caught for subsistence consumption and it is also persecuted as a pest, however these birds would usually be eaten as well (Dodman 1995c, Warburton and Perrin 2005c<strong></strong><strong></strong>)<strong></strong>. Farmers take measures to mitigate damage to crops<strong></strong>, but they are largely ineffective and rarely lethal (Dodman 1995c, Warburton 2003)<strong></strong>. The current levels of hunting and capture are unlikely to have any serious long-term impact on the population, but could threaten local populations suffering from the effects of desiccation (Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. Recently there may have been local declines due to loss of surface water supplies in the dry season, perhaps due to long-term climate change<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Dodman 1995b, c, Warburton 1999b, Dodman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2000)<strong></strong>. The direct effect of climate change on the species's habitat may not be that great, but the indirect effect through the effect on human populations could have a large impact on the species (Segan <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;The number of permanent water sources in mopane woodland has decreased since the early 20th century<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. The low availability of water in the dry season is probably the principal factor in the disappearance of permanent populations from the Bovu and Sinde Rivers, and changes to the Ngweze River population (Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. This is exacerbated by a decrease in the annual rainfall in the species's habitat of, on average, about 5 mm per year between 1950 and 1995, increasing the species's reliance on artificial water sources (Warburton and Perrin 2005d)<strong></strong>. The recent establishment of hand-pumped boreholes along the catchments of the Ngweze, Sichifulo, and Machile rivers may lead to a decrease in the availability of surface water as people reduce their water source creation activities in riverbeds (Warburton and Perrin 2005d)<strong></strong>. In some areas, water pools are poisoned to kill fish and this can impact the species (Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. The species may be threatened by the declining dry-season availability of water in temporary rivers in south-western Zambia, due to declining levels of rainfall<strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> (T. </strong>Dodman<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>.

Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease Virus is present in the wild population (Warburton 2003, Warburton and Perrin 2005c)<strong></strong>, but there is no evidence that this is a serious threat. <p></p>","The population, based on surveys in 1994, has been estimated at c.10,000 individuals, however due to suspected declines in the population since this year, the population is placed in the range bracket 2,500-9,999 mature individuals.

Throughout the 1980s the species suffered major declines as an estimated 10,000 birds were illegally captured for the pet trade and widespread habitat destruction and hunting caused a further reduction in numbers (Anon. 2004). The majority of the population is now located in the Pantanal, where since 1990 the species has shown signs of a recovery and expanded its range (Pinho and Nogueira 2003, Anon. 2004), probably in response to conservation projects. Populations in east Amazonia and the Gerais have continued to decline, from an estimated 1,500 individuals in 1986 to 1,000 in 2003. The total population was estimated at 6,500 individuals in 2003, of which 5,000 were in the Pantanal (Anon. 2004) and around 200 in Bolivia (M.

It suffers from capture for the cage-bird trade, with 183 individuals arriving in the USA from Paraguay between 1977 and 1979 (Chebez 1994).

The species is found in MarajÃÂ³ island, ParÃÂ¡ (where it is common in mangrove forest and cerrado), over most of Brazil to ParanÃÂ¡ and adjoining parts of Paraguay. There are no recent records from Misiones, Argentina and it is thought to be virtually extinct in the country<strong> </strong>(Bodrati <em>et al. </em>2006). In SÃÂ£o Paulo state, the species has its stronghold in and around Caetetus Ecological Station. In Brazil, this macaw is found in a broad range of habitats, including mangrove forest in MarajÃÂ³, semi-deciduous and humid forest in southern ParÃÂ¡ and SÃÂ£o Paulo, Atlantic forest in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia and Espirito Santo, cerrado in Tocantins, and caatinga in Bahia and PiauÃÂ­. Despite declines in the southern part of its range the species remains widespread over most of its Brazilian range, and has even recolonised areas in its historical range in southern Rio de Janeiro, including the environs of Itatiaia National Park<strong> </strong>(Collar 1997a). Some areas considered as strongholds for the species are largely protected (Serra do Cachimbo in ParÃÂ¡ is mostly under care of the Brazilian military, who bar colonists and loggers, although they conduct weapon tests in parts of the range) or not under strong pressure (MarajÃÂ³).

Breeding apparently occurs in the austral spring, when 2-4 eggs are laid in a tree-cavity.<p></p>","Extensive and continuing forest clearance is responsible for its current fragmented distribution. Its apparent tolerance of shade cacao plantations provides little hope because shading techniques since the 1980s have involved the use of banana and <em>Erythrina</em> trees, rather than standing forest, and unstable prices have resulted in conversion to pasture.

This estimate is equivalent to 3,750-14,999 individuals, rounded here to 3,500-15,000 individuals.","<em>Pyrrhura cruentata</em> was formerly common throughout much of south-east Bahia, EspÃÂ­rito Santo, east Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, <strong>Brazil</strong>.

Although it remains common in some areas and the status is clouded by feral/escaped populations, it is suspected to be undergoing a moderately rapid population decline owing to on-going habitat loss, persecution and trapping pressure.","This species inhabits a variety of moist and dry forests and woodlands, as well as cultivated areas, mangroves and plantations, mainly below 900 m, but reaching c.1,600 m locally (Juniper and Parr 1998). In Cambodia, the species inhabits dry deciduous forest and degraded semi-evergreen forest, but also riverine forest, in the lowlands mostly below 300 m (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013). It feeds on a range of wild and cultivated seeds, flowers, flower buds, nectar, grain, fruit and vegetables (Juniper and Parr 1998). It is considered a serious pest in some areas, with c.70% of its diet in farmed areas of Pakistan attributed to crops. It nests in tree cavities, palms, and very rarely buildings, and generally breeds from November to April, depending on the location (Juniper and Parr 1998).","This species is widely captured and traded as a cage-bird. In Cambodia, targeted nest-robbing and capture of  adults pose the main threats, as it is one of the most sought-after species as a cage-bird (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013) and is used in 'merit releases' (Gilbert <em>et al. </em>2012). Despite the near-disappearance of the species from Thailand, nestlings  still appear in illegal  trade in Bangkok bird markets, although they  possibly originate from Cambodia (P. Round <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Illegal trade, as well as the destruction of nest-sites, threatens the species in Pakistan (S. Khan <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Likewise, it is reported that the species is threatened by extensive poaching by local tribes in Gujarat (V. Vyas <em>in litt</em>.  2013). Habitat loss and degradation are also serious threats. In Cambodia, land-use changes in the lowlands have been rapid (R. Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013) and expected rates of degradation and loss of lowland forest are  further expected to impact the species (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Rates of habitat conversion in Laos are described as severe (J. W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2013).","The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is reported to be of variable abundance across its range.","<em>Psittacula eupatria</em> is widespread in South and South-East Asia, ranging from <strong>Pakistan</strong>, through most of <strong>India</strong> (including the Andaman Islands and Narcondam Island), <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>, much of <strong>Nepal</strong>, <strong>Bhutan</strong> and <strong>Bangladesh</strong> (including Cocos Island), into southern and central <strong>Myanmar</strong>, central <strong>Thailand</strong>, southern and western <strong>Laos</strong>, much of <strong>Cambodia</strong> and southern <strong>Vietnam</strong> (Juniper and Parr 1998). It is noted to show seasonal movements in some parts of its range and nomadism in others. It is described as generally common, but much scarcer in the east of its range, sporadic in southern India and rare in Sri Lanka. Declines are evident in some regions (Juniper and Parr 1998). The species is described as scarce or uncommon in Cambodia (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013, T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2013), having been much reduced, and is now only locally common in the north   and north-east, although never in large flocks (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013).  It has been almost extirpated from north-western and south-western  Cambodia, and the only site known for the species in the south-east,  where it was historically present, may be occupied by a population that  originated from cage-birds. The populations in the north  and north-east  of Cambodia are said to remain healthy and widespread across  near-continuous  habitat (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013). It is highly localised in Laos, having formerly been present more widely, probably across the country's lowland plain (Thewlis <em>et al. </em>1998, Duckworth <em>et al. </em>1999). It has almost entirely disappeared from Thailand, with the only remaining individuals in small populations, with all known  sites being close   to major human settlements, perhaps implying that  they originate from escaped cage-birds (P.  Round <em>in litt</em>. 2013). The species is common in Jharkhand, India (S. Prakash <em>in litt</em>. 2013) and  appears to be increasing in Gujarat (I. R. Gadhvi <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Recent records in Bangladesh are all from  Dhaka city and presumably relate to  escapes, which are probably breeding there (S. U. Choudhury <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Two small breeding populations were known to occur in north Bengal; however, recent searches  have failed to find them (S. U. Choudhury <em>in litt</em>. 2013).

Birds have been recorded in breeding condition in June and breeding has been reported between February and August (White and Bruce 1986, Reeve and Rabenak 2016).","Habitat destruction through the combined impacts of firewood  collection, commercial logging, timber extraction for construction  materials, and clearance for agriculture together may represent the most  pertinent threat. The loss and fragmentation of forests is already  extensive on Flores, where no semi-evergreen forest below 1,000 m is  included within gazetted protected areas. These threats are compounded  by human population expansion, with large volumes of timber required for  housing construction, and the fact that there is little or no  governmental enforcement of laws. Moist deciduous forest is currently  being extensively cleared through land grabbing and establishment of  agricultural areas, a factor that is inevitably reducing the range and  population of this species. Forest clearance continues in the coastal  belt to make way for crops, and illegal logging continues in protected  areas.

It therefore qualifies as Vulnerable.<br/><p></p> <p></p>,"It occurs most commonly in montane forest, and rarely in gardens and coconut plantations, although this may reflect variations in trapping pressure rather than habitat preference. Moreover, while it is tolerant of logging, the highest densities are to be found in primary forest; and most encounters of this species are in forest generally distant from areas of human activity (Bashari 2012). It is a canopy species, occasionally descending to the lower canopy to feed, and typically nesting in holes in very tall trees. It occurs regularly up to 1,000 m, but has been recorded at 1,100 m with the potential to be found at higher elevations (Bashari 2012, Mittermeier <em>et al. </em>2013, Thibault <em>et al. </em>2013).<p></p>","The main threat stems from trapping for the cage-bird trade. This is the most popular bird exported from east Indonesia, largely owing to its strong imitative abilities. Several thousand individuals were legally taken from the wild annually during the 1980s and early 1990s, although the true figure was probably much higher. Legal trade declined through the 1990s and ceased in 2003 <strong></strong>(Poulsen <em>et al. </em>1999); however, illegal trade continues: in 2007 around 2,800 were recorded as poached and in 2008, 60 were recorded in trade in Javan bird markets <strong></strong>(R. Nursahid <span style=""font-style: italic;"">per</span> J. Gilardi <em>in litt. </em>2009). Forests within its range were largely intact at the outset of the 1990s, but exploitation by logging companies for economically valuable timber has become intensive (e.g. Vetter 2009). Important nesting-trees are targeted for extraction because of their large size, and with logging roads greatly facilitating access for trappers, this represents an increasingly significant combination of threats. <p></p>","A population size of 46,000-295,000 individuals was estimated by Lambert (1993a, b) although subsequent work in 1994 suggests the population may at that time have been considerably higher.","<em>Lorius garrulus</em> is endemic to North Maluku, <strong>Indonesia</strong>, where it is known from Morotai, Rau, Halmahera, Widi, Ternate, Bacan and Obi (BirdLife International 2001). It is locally common, but rare near settlements and plantations. In 1991-1992, the population was estimated at 46,360-295,540 birds, with trappers potentially removing c.10% annually, a clearly unsustainable rate of harvest. However, in 1994, 52,500 individuals (39,600-69,900) were estimated in only 1,060 km<sup>2</sup> of forest on Halmahera, suggesting a higher population than initially calculated. Very high densities can apparently be sustained in primary rainforest: this habitat at Miaf yielded an estimate of 149.0 (116.6-190.4) birds per km<sup>2</sup>. <p></p>",,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II. In 2002, ProFauna Indonesia, in collaboration with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) from the UK, launched a report to publicise the numbers of parrots trapped in North Maluku in 2001 (R. Tri Prayudhi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2008). This was followed by campaigns conducted by ProFauna Indonesia, supported by Yayasan KAMU, a local NGO.

Now that it is extinct in much of its historic range, and some protected populations are increasing, the rate of decline may have slowed or the decline may even have stopped. However, the bulk of the past declines are believed to have occurred within the past three generations and so it is assessed as Critically Endangered.<br/><p></p> <p></p>","It appears to be restricted to lowland primary and/or secondary forest predominantly below 50 m, in or adjacent to riverine or coastal areas with mangroves. It breeds between January and July, and outside the breeding season it frequents both corn and rice fields. It depends on seasonally fluctuating food resources and is partially nomadic. Birds fly from the mainland to offshore islands as far as 8 km away from the mainland to roost and breed. The species is able to utilise regenerating forest for foraging and, if suitable trees are present, breeding (P. Widmann <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012).<br/><p></p>","On Palawan, Polillo and Samar, trapping was particularly serious, and the high price fetched per bird (c.US$160 in Manila in 1997 and US$300 in 2006) means that chicks were taken from virtually every accessible nest,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">however this trade has now virtually ceased due to the very low numbers of birds in these localities (P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2016). High numbers were (legally) traded internationally in the 1980s (e.g. 422 in 1983). Poaching of nestlings and snares possibly intended for roosting cockatoos have also been noted during initial conservation work on Pandanan Island,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">but this threat ceased due to the implementation of an intensive wildlife warden and nest protection scheme (P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2016). During nest monitoring on Pandanan, illegal tree cutting was also documented (Anon. 2010)<strong></strong>. Lowland deforestation and mangrove destruction have been extensive throughout its range, and have contributed significantly to its decline. It is also persecuted as a crop-pest and hunted for food. Typhoons are a threat, at least in already declining populations. Very dry breeding seasons may lead to partial or complete breeding failure, e.g. b<span lang=""EN-US"">reeding success on Pandanan and Rasa in 2016 was low and catastrophic on Dumaran (where all surviving nestlings were rescued) due to effects in El NiÃÂ±o<span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;(P.

Recent attempts to establish a large-scale biofuel plantation in  cockatoo habitats on Dumaran, and a coal-fired power plant in the  immediate vicinity of Rasa Island (which held c.280 individuals in 2012), were only prevented by major advocacy campaigns and remain potential threats (P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2013, Anon. 2013).&#160;Recreational activities may also play an increased role in the future, as a roost site was abandoned shortly after its location was publicised on social media (P.

In 1950, it was common throughout but a rapid decline has left a population of c. 650-1,120 birds (P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2016). Of these, there are 580-850 on Palawan and its satellite islands, ""several hundred"" or 50-150 in Sulu (I. Sarenas <em>pers. comm. per </em>P.

Conservation efforts are underway at four sites; including on Rasa Island near Narra, Palawan, where the population increased from 23 in 1998 to over 200 in 2008 and 260-340 individuals by end of 2015 (Widmann and Widmann<em> </em>2008, Anon. 2010, P.

It is known from five protected areas: Rasa Island Wildlife Sanctuary, Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, Omoi and Manambaling Cockatoo Reserves in Dumaran, Culasian Managed Resource Protected Area in Rizal and Samar Island Natural Park. Since 1998 an intensive species conservation programme, the Philippine Cockatoo Conservation Program (PCCP) has been implemented by the Katala Foundation. In 2005, the Katala Foundation started to plan and build the Katala Institute for Ecology and Biodiversity Conservation, designed as a centre for environmental education and research, as well as possibly serving a role as a facility for the captive breeding of the species. Three protected areas have been specifically created for the species in Palawan on Rasa Island, Dumaran and Rizal. Conservation efforts on Rasa Island recovered a small population from 23 individuals to over 200 by July 2008 (Widmann and Widmann<em> </em>2008) and 260-340 by the end of 2015 (P. Widmann <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2016)<strong></strong>. Poachers have been trained as wildlife wardens and were provided with alternative sources of income. This turned out to be the single most effective activity to prevent poaching and was repeated in three other project sites.<br/><br/>Awareness campaigns have been conducted on Mindanao, Palawan and Polillo. Trilingual conservation posters have been distributed nationwide. The Katala Pride Campaign launched on Dumaran Island has focused on raising awareness among students and farmers (Anon. 2005)<strong></strong>. In 1992, an international captive-breeding programme was initiated, with 39 birds kept under the European Studbook in 2007 (P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. In 2005, drought caused the starvation of 15 chicks, so 10 chicks were hand-reared for an experimental translocation (Widmann and Widmann 2005)<strong></strong>. An extreme drought in 2010, possibly worse than that in 2005, resulted in only 15 of 25 nests on Rasa producing a total of 24 young, of which only five survived until late April and were rescued for supplementary feeding<strong></strong>. Supplemental food and water were provided for adult birds on Rasa to mitigate the effects of the drought (Anon. 2010), and this was again conducted during drought in 2016, though nestlings on Damaran were rescued to prevent starvation (P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2016).<span lang=""EN-US""><br/><br/>Currently, sites are assessed and tested for their suitability for translocation. A first attempt on a resort island in northern Palawan indicated that rescued hand-raised birds can adapt well to natural conditions (foraging, predator avoidance), but was terminated owing to problems caused by tameness. Conservation efforts started in 2010 at a new project site on Pandanan Island to the south of Palawan (Anon. 2010)<strong></strong>, where surveys confirmed the presence of a viable population (Widmann and Lacerna-Widmann 2009)<strong></strong>.&#160;Meetings, focus groups and other events have been held to engage local communities, and alternative income sources are being promoted to reduce trapping pressure (Anon. 2010)<strong></strong>.    Experimental habitat restoration has been initiated at Dumaran and one mainland site in Palawan.

Should the species be found to be declining at a more moderate rate, this species will warrant downlisting to a lower category of threat.<p></p>","It is restricted to hill and lower montane forest, and adjacent lowland forest from 20-2,420 m (Mack and Wright 1998, Beehler and Pratt 2016, I. Woxvold <em>per </em>G. Dutson&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). It is widespread and fairly commonly encountered. In areas of relatively intact forest with low hunting pressure, this species is commonly seen as singles or pairs and sometimes in groups of up to ten in fruiting trees and up to 14 at roost (I. Woxvold&#160;<em>per&#160;</em>G. Dutson&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Recorded daily at 600Ã¢ÂÂ2,420 m in the YUS conservation area (Freeman <em>et al.</em> 2013). Encounter rates are often similar in logged forest (I. Woxvold&#160;<em>per&#160;</em>G. Dutson&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). It is an extremely specialised frugivore, feeding only on a very few species of fig, and is probably seasonally nomadic. It nests in large, hollow trees, lays one or two eggs (Richards and Whitmore 2015, Pratt and Beehler 2015) and may have a lifespan of 20-40 years (Mack and Wright 1998).&#160;<p></p>","The major threat is hunting for feathers (Coates 1985, Beehler <em>et al.</em> 1986, Mack and Wright 1998), which are used for ornamentation, particularly in ceremonial head-dresses, in much of the Papua New Guinea Highlands and, in some areas, for skins, which are used as bride prices (Schmid 1993). Demand may increase as the population grows, however, the plumes of this species are not worn as commonly as those of other birds (M. Supuma <em>in litt.</em> 2012) and many feathers may be decades old as they tend to be carefully stored when not being used (B. Beehler<em> in litt. </em>2012). In addition, hunting levels potentially have decreased since the introduction of a law preventing the killing of birds with non-traditional means (i.e. shotguns) (G. Dutson <em>in litt. </em>2016). Tourist shows and cultural events have however increased in recent years, which may increase demand for plumes, and birds or feathers are occasionally sold to tourists (van den Bergh 2009) although it is illegal to take them out of the country. Despite demand being generally lower in Papua, birds are also hunted for the cage-bird trade and meat (Nash 1992, K. D. Bishop <em>in litt. </em>1994). Nestlings are captured by felling trees or enlarging nest-cavities, and the scarcity of suitable nest-sites could become a limiting factor. Deforestation is a less major threat to the species since loggers usually leave fig trees (B. Beehler <em>in litt.</em> 2007) and encounter rates for the species are often similar in logged forest (I. Woxvold <em>per </em>G. Dutson <em>in litt.</em> 2016).<p></p>","The only population estimate is based on two pairs inhabiting 14 km<sup>2</sup> at Crater Mountain. Extrapolation suggests a total population of 21,000 pairs (Mack and Wright 1998), which may be placed in the range 20,000-49,999 mature individuals. However, this may have been an overestimate as the Crater Mountain birds sometimes foraged elsewhere, the species is atypically common at this site and is absent from many hunted areas (Mack and Wright 1998). Conversely, it may be an underestimate by not accounting for substantial populations at lower altitudes (B. Beehler <em>in litt.</em> 2000).&#160;<p></p>","<em>Psittrichas fulgidus </em>is patchily distributed across New Guinea (Papua, formerly Irian Jaya, <strong>Indonesia</strong>, and <strong>Papua New Guinea</strong>). It has been historically and recently extirpated from large areas, especially in Papua New Guinea (Coates 1985, Beehler <em>et al.</em> 1986, K. D. Bishop <em>in litt.</em> 1994, Mack and Wright 1998). It is generally rare and seen in small numbers (birds are wide-ranging) (B. Beehler <em>in litt.</em> 2007), and has shown rapid declines in some areas such as Ok Tedi (K. D. Bishop <em>in litt.</em> 1994, Gregory 1995). While it has been reported as frequently seen near villages in the Finisterre Mountains, Huon Peninsula (T. Mark <em>in litt. </em>2017), in other areas, such as Kiunga and Tabubil, it is considered difficult to find (P. Gregory <em>in litt. </em>2017).

Further clarification is needed as to whether any Brazilian subpopulations exceed 250 individuals. <p></p>","It inhabits lowland and highland Atlantic forest up to 2,000 m, and ecotones between this forest and grasslands (southern Misiones) and cerrado (Paraguay). There is a strong association with <em>Araucaria angustifolia</em> in Rio Grande do Sul and some correlation in the historical distributions of bird and tree, but <em>Amazona vinacea</em> was distributed throughout eastern Paraguay and southern and western Misiones, Argentina, where there has been no <em>Araucaria angustifolia</em> in historic times, and many other food sources are utilised, including seeds of many native and exotic species, even in areas with <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Araucaria </span>forest<strong></strong><strong> </strong>(<strong></strong>Lowen <em>et al</em>. 1996, <strong></strong>Juniper and Parr 1998, Cockle <em>et al.</em> 2007). It nests from September to January in cavities in various tree species<strong> </strong>(Cockle <em>et al.</em> 2007). Significant movements may occur in Brazil, possibly dictated by intra- and inter-year variations in <em>Araucaria </em>cone-crop production, but these do not affect the Argentinian or Paraguayan populations. During the breeding season, it is found in pairs or small groups (probably non-reproductive individuals); after the breeding season (February to July), the species congregates in large groups and roosts communally<strong> </strong>(K. Cockle, A. Bodrati, N. FariÃÂ±a and J. Segovia <em>in litt. </em>2007).  <p></p>","In 1984-1991, 38% of Paraguay's Atlantic forests disappeared<strong></strong> (Huespe Fatecha<em> et al</em>. 1994), and range contractions in Brazil presumably result from similarly extensive deforestation. There is some correlation with the disappearance of <em>Araucaria</em> forest e.g. in ParanÃÂ¡, 73,780 km<sup>2</sup> of <em>Araucaria</em> forest was reduced to 15,932 km<sup>2</sup> in 1965<strong> </strong>(Hueck 1978). Selective logging, colonisation and plantation agriculture threaten remaining forests (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 1995). However, in Argentina, <em>Amazona vinacea</em> has disappeared from large forest reserves (e.g. the 1,500 km<sup>2</sup> IguazÃÂº-Urugua-ÃÂ­ forest complex), remaining mostly in the mosaic of small farms and degraded forest remnants between San Pedro and Santa Rosa. There, where the wild population numbers approximately 200 individuals, 40 individuals were found in captivity in 35 homes between 2003 and 2005<strong> </strong>(Cockle <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. &#160; In 2006 and 2007, from twelve nests identified in this area, only one chick fledged; at least three nests were predated, at least two were flooded during storms, and at three nests the chicks were captured for sale to Brazil<strong> </strong>(Proyecto Selva de Pino ParanÃÂ¡ <em>in litt. </em>2007). In the anthropogenic habitat that <em>A. vinacea</em> selects in Argentina, there appear to be few appropriate nest cavities, and most nests are in large, shallow, cavities which are easily predated or flooded during storms<strong> </strong>(Proyecto Selva de Pino ParanÃÂ¡ <em>in litt. </em>2007). Furthermore, the species appears to be very conservative in selecting nest sites, returning year after year to cavities that continually fail<strong> </strong>(Proyecto Selva de Pino ParanÃÂ¡ <em>in litt. </em>2007). &#160;Interviews in 2015 - 2016 suggested that nest poaching continues to be a problem in Argentina (K. Cockle&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). &#160;Competition with other hole nesting animals may also be important: in the above mentioned nests in Argentina in 2007, <em>A. vinacea</em> apparently lost competitions for nest cavities with exotic honeybees, possums, and several species of hole-nesting birds, apparently during the incubation stage<strong> </strong>(Proyecto Selva de Pino ParanÃÂ¡ <em>in litt. </em>2007). Internal trade has probably affected Brazilian and Argentine populations, and one massive bird-smuggling operation was centred in Paraguay and included <em>A. vinacea</em> (Endangered Species Bull. 1995 20[2]:7). The species was also shot as a crop pest in certain areas<strong> </strong>(White 1882<strong>, </strong>Chebez 1992), but this does not appear to be an important threat today (Cockle <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><p></p>","Based on estimates of 1,500-2,000 individuals in Brazil (G. Bencke <em>in litt.</em> 2009), 220-400 in Paraguay and 262-314 plus &lt;20 in Argentina (K. Cockle <em>in litt.</em> 2016), the total population is believed to lie within the range 1,992-2,733 individuals (rounded here to 2,000-2,700 individuals). This equates to 1328 - 1822 mature individuals and is placed within the band 1,000-2,499 mature individuals.","<em>Amazona vinacea</em> has become rare throughout its extensive range. In the early 1980s, <strong>Paraguay</strong> was considered the global stronghold, but all remaining subpopulations in CanindeyÃÂº, Alto ParanÃÂ¡, and CaaguazÃÂº number fewer than c.200 birds<strong> </strong><strong> </strong>(Wege and Long 1995, <strong></strong>Lowen <em>et al</em>. 1996, Cockle <em>et al.</em> 2007). The ItaipÃÂº reserves and Reserva Natural Privada ItabÃÂ³ are key sites and the minimum remaining population in Paraguay has been estimated at 220 birds<strong> </strong>(Cockle <em>et al.</em> 2007). There are no recent records from CaazapÃÂ¡ or ConcepciÃÂ³n, and it has probably been extirpated in Amambay (where its historical occurrence is doubtful), ItapÃÂºa and GuairÃÂ¡. It is perhaps most common in Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and ParanÃÂ¡ (several populations of more than 100 birds), southern <strong>Brazil</strong>, and low numbers persist in Minas Gerais and SÃÂ£o Paulo, within an estimated national total of 1,500-2,000 birds<strong> </strong>(G. A. Bencke and A. E. Rupp <em>in litt. </em>2009). It was possibly never common, and must be close to extinction in Bahia, EspÃÂ­rito Santo and Rio de Janeiro. In <strong>Argentina</strong>, few populations remain in Misiones, and the species's stronghold is the mosaic of small farms and forest remnants between San Pedro and Santa Rosa (San Pedro Important Bird Area)<strong> </strong>(Bodrati <em>et al. </em>2005), with two small additional populations near Campo Viera and Bernardo de Yrigoyen<strong> </strong>(Cockle <em>et al.</em> 2007).

Cockle <em>in litt.</em> 2016).&#160;&#160;A recent regional census, which was carried out simultaneously in Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, counted a total which was similar to that observed during the previous project during 2013-2014, but smaller than that found by Cockle <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2007) (A.&#160;Lesterhuis <em>in litt.</em> 2016).<p></p>",,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I and II and protected under Brazilian law.

For this reason it is listed as Endangered.<p></p>,"It mostly inhabits high-altitude forest and alpine basins, although birds will often frequent and nest in coastal lowland flats. Its foraging habitat includes all types of native forest, sub-alpine scrub, tussock and herb-field. It mostly feeds on berries and shoots, although many have adapted to feeding at refuse dumps and ski-fields. It nests in holes, under logs or in rocky crevasses, mainly within forest. It usually incubates up to four eggs. Males feed the females during incubation and after hatching. Birds breed after three or more years. The oldest recorded wild bird was at least 22 years of age (T. Orr-Walker <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>","Up until its partial protection in the early 1970s, over 150,000 were shot in a bounty scheme, established because rogue individuals were found to be attacking sheep as a source of fat. Deforestation for pasture has placed pressure on the species, and farmers still kill an unknown number of birds each year (Mosen 2009). Introduced mammalian predators such as stoats <em>Mustela erminea</em>, cats and brush-tailed possums <em>Trichosurus vulpecula</em> have spread into most of the species's range. Episodic, high mortality events are thought to be associated with Ã¢ÂÂplaguesÃ¢ÂÂ of stoats <em>Mustela erminea</em> which occur after mast seeding of native beech and rimu (Kemp 2013). Monitoring by the Department of Conservation between 2009-2014 found that only 2% of kea nests in areas without pest control were successful, in contrast with a 27% success rate&#160;in areas treated with aerial 1080 in 2015 (Department of Conservation 2016). It is estimated that around 60% of kea nests are normally attacked by predators, especially stoats, which may also kill adults; this can rise to as many as 99% of nests being attacked in a stoat Ã¢ÂÂplagueÃ¢ÂÂ (Department of Conservation 2016). Birds are sometimes killed through accidents with human objects (e.g. motor vehicles, snow groomers, rubbish bins, electricity sub-stations) (Orr-Walker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Ingestion of lead from building components and the 1080 toxin used in invasive control have potentially widespread impacts on the population (T.

Mining operations also potentially threaten the species's remaining habitat (D. Allen <em>in litt. </em>2016). The tameness of this parrot, combined with the high rate of gun ownership in its range, have made it an easy target in the past. As of January 2012, logging was said to be on-going (R.

At the turn of the century it was described as locally abundant but, by the 1970s, it had evidently undergone a huge decline. There have been no records from Tumindao and Manuk Manka for c.80  years (but there may have been a lack of search effort during this  time), and it is regarded as probably extinct on Bongao and Sanga-sanga,  although it could persist on Sibutu (D. Allen <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Very small numbers persisted at three sites (Buan, Tarawakan and Parangan) on Tawi-Tawi in the early 1990s, with the situation apparently continuing to deteriorate.

The species is consequently listed as Least Concern. If it is demonstrated that the loss of dead trees is likely to cause significant future declines in the global population, the status of this and other nest hollow-dependent species would warrant reconsideration.<br/>  <p></p>","It nests in the New South Wales and Victorian Riverina in loose colonies in riparian woodland of river red gum <em>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</em> and forages in box woodland. On the slopes of the Great Dividing Range, it forages and nests in box-gum woodland, preferring highly modified, open habitat such as scattered paddock trees on private agricultural land (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2004, <em></em>2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Nesting birds on the South-West Slopes show clear preferences for Blakely's red gum trees <em>E. blakelyi</em>, dead and aging trees in general, and larger trees, as all of these factors are correlated with the presence of suitable nest hollows (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The species also shows a preference for lower elevations in this area, which are dominated by agriculture (Manning <em>et al. </em>2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, in contrast to the poorer soils and lower temperatures of higher elevations (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In the Riverina, it feeds on the seeds of herbaceous plants, switching to lerp, mistletoe berries, eucalypt flowers and grass seed in winter, and forages up to 15 km from the nest. In contrast, it appears that the most important habitats for breeding birds on the South-West Slopes are within 3 km of nest-sites (Manning <em>et al. </em>2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.  <p></p>","Range contraction is largely the result of clearing for agriculture. Decreases in the species's abundance are linked to land clearing that does not leave scattered trees in the landscape (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Remaining habitat is often fragmented, with feeding and breeding habitats divided. Regeneration is commonly prevented by high grazing levels by stock and rabbits or inappropriate fire regimes. Scattered box-gum woodland is threatened by limited regeneration, rural tree dieback, removal of trees and firewood collection (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In breeding areas the majority of nest trees are often on private land, with scattered paddock trees in mixed agricultural land of vital importance on the South-West Slopes. Nest-site fidelity means that birds continue to use traditional breeding sites despite habitat loss and degradation (Leslie 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Many nest trees are dead, particularly on inland slopes, and have no replacements when they fall or are cut for firewood, potentially resulting in competition with other species, particularly the Common Starling <em>Sturnus vulgaris</em>. There are limited provisions for the protection of dead trees, and due to continued illegal removal and natural loss of old trees a decline in nest site availability is inevitable (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In areas of low occupancy, the availability of food in the breeding season, and not that of nest hollows, may limit population size (Leslie 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In the Riverina, altered flooding regimes may compromise the health and extent of riparian woodlands where this species nests (C. Tzaros and M. A. Weston <em>in litt. </em>2003)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Illegal trapping occurs, but is a far less significant threat than habitat loss. Birds are also killed on roadsides and possibly suffer from pesticide poisoning. The abundance and distribution of the species appears to be affected by changes in plant productivity, as influenced by climate (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It is therefore susceptible to climate change and its interaction with fragmentation (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.  <p></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-AU"">An expert review panel considered it highly likely that the population in 2010 exceeded 10,000 mature individuals, probably by many thousands (Garnett <em>et al. </em>2011). A study systematically sampling 23,000 km<sup>2</sup> of parrot habitat on the western slopes in 2001 (Manning <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007) found nearly 1,500 parrots in 53 out of 81 well-separated sites. Furthermore they were reported from throughout the landscape, not just where there were corridors of trees as had previously been thought essential for the species. A simple extrapolation of these results gives a total population of over 400,000 individuals. While no member of the Australian Threatened Species Committee thought this number likely, they thought it highly unlikely the total could be as low as 10,000. The total is thus placed here in the band 10,000-19,999 mature individuals but may prove to be higher.  </p>","<em>Polytelis swainsonii</em> is endemic to Victoria and New South Wales, <strong>Australia</strong>. It has undergone a substantial historical range contraction, and bioclimatic modelling of suitable climatic conditions within its range supports this and suggests that it now occupies a relatively small part of its former range (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. In Victoria, it is now largely confined to the Nathalia area, especially Barmah State Forest, birds having disappeared from central and southern areas in the early 1900s, and it has substantially declined in northern Victoria by 1930. In New South Wales, it has declined in the Parkes district since the 1960s. However, its range may have extended to Deniliquin and in northern New South Wales over the same period, and apparent increases have been noted in Canberra.

Furthermore they were reported from throughout the landscape, not just  where there were corridors of trees as had previously been thought  essential for the species. A simple extrapolation of these results gives  a total population of over 400,000 individuals. While such a figure is  unlikely, it is also highly unlikely the total could be as low as  10,000, and an <span lang=""EN-AU"">expert review panel considered it highly likely  that the population in 2010 exceeded 10,000 mature individuals, probably  by many thousands (Garnett <em>et al. </em>2011). Variation in the recorded abundance of the species, due to its movements, may mask population trends, and compounds the reliability of population estimates (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>.  However, the Atlas reporting rate increased by 61 per cent between the  averages for 1977-1981 and 1998-2009, and there is no evidence that  increases in Canberra in the last decade have been accompanied by losses  elsewhere in the range. The South-West Slopes of New South Wales appear to have become the most important area for the species, perhaps as habitat in other areas deteriorates (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. <br/><p></p></span>",,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II.

Guidelines have been developed for forestry in riparian breeding habitat, but these have sometimes been inadvertently ignored. <p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Refine monitoring techniques. Extend surveys of nest trees. Determine the extent of trade. Protect all known breeding and feeding habitat from clearance, including scattered paddock trees on private agricultural land (A.

Critical food resources occur within this habitat, principally nectar from prolific flowering species such as red ironbark <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. tricarpa</span>, grey box <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. microcarpa</span>, yellow gum <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. leucoxylon</span> and mugga ironbark <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. sideroxylon </span>on the western slopes, and Swamp Mahogany<span style=""font-style: italic;""> E. robusta</span> and spotted gum<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Corymbia maculata</span> in coastal areas.<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>Lerp (sugary secretions from sap sucking insects on leaves; D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2007) is also a favoured food source and is occasionally preffered over blossom, even when abundant blossom is available where birds are present (M. Roderick, D. Ingwersen pers. obs.). During the winter the birds are semi-nomadic and visit a network of traditional sites in reaction to flowering events and lerp availability (Kennedy and Tzaros 2005). Their wintering distribution varies greatly between years, depending on climatic conditions and the resulting food availability (Saunders and Heinsohn 2008). However it will also repeatedly use the same sites between years and often remain in winter foraging habitats for extended periods within a season (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). In some years, urban landscapes containing indigenous or non-local flowering eucalypts are also readily used (C. Tzaros <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2003). The importance of larger trees as a food source has been shown in this species's breeding range (Brereton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004) and wintering range (Kennedy and Tzaros 2005), as such trees tend to offer a more reliable and abundant source of nectar. Individuals can travel up to 5,000 kilometres between their mainland wintering grounds and their Tasmanian breeding sites, making theirs the longest migration undertaken by any parrot in the world (Tzaros <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).<br/><p></p>","Nest predation by Sugar Gliders&#160;<em>Petaurus breviceps</em> introduced to Tasmania&#160;poses a severe threat (Stojanovic&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) and is estimated to cause severe declines over the next three generations (Heinsohn <em>et al.</em> 2015). Surveys revealed that&#160;Sugar Gliders&#160;predated nests and the probability of a nest surviving the 60-day nesting period when&#160;Sugar Gliders&#160;were present was 0.17&#160;(Stojanovic&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). On mainland Tasmania almost 79% nests were predated and 65% of adult females were killed by Sugar Gliders. Predation was most severe in locations with low forest cover. Owing to the fact that Swift Parrot breeding distribution varies widely between years the extent of nest predation is also expected to vary annually depending on the distribution of&#160;Sugar Gliders&#160;and forest cover. Sugar Gliders have not been reported from Bruny Island, a Swift Parrot breeding site.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and alteration within breeding and drought refuge habitats remains a key threat. In Tasmania, breeding habitat is significantly reduced and fragmented through clearance of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. globulus</span> for agriculture, residential development, plantation timber, sawlog production and clear-felling for woodchips. In 2017, a large area of key nesting habitat has been logged for timber extraction (D. Stojanovic <em>in litt</em>. 2017). Over 50% of the original grassy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. globulus</span> forest in Tasmania has been cleared (Brereton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004). Selective logging has resulted in the removal of larger trees from the remaining forest patches. Such patches are typically unfenced and exhibit poor regeneration (Brereton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004). Competition for remaining nest-sites with Common Starlings <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sturnus vulgaris</span> could be a problem along forest edges. Even with protection of remaining habitat (80% private land), maintenance and recovery may be limited by the dependence of breeding on an irregular nectar supply. It also suffers high mortality through collision with windows, vehicles and fences. On the mainland, clearance and degradation of habitat for agriculture, forestry and residential and commercial development has had the biggest impact (D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2007). Much of the preferred lowland habitat on the most fertile and productive sites has been cleared or substantially modified (C. Tzaros <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2003). Drought refuge habitats continue to be cleared and fragmented for coastal developments (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Remnants, including much of what currently exists in the conservation reserve system, have been heavily cut-over and degraded, and this practice is continuing in many areas, including hardwood production forests. This practice is considered to result in poor and unreliable nectar-sources through the reduction of large mature trees. Competition from large nectarivores honeyeaters and the introduced Bumblebee <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bombus terrestris </span>may be exacerbated by forest fragmentation. In winter, the species relies heavily on public land that has been exploited for timber, honey and minerals (Kennedy and Tzaros 2005).&#160;<br/><br/>Global warming threatens to alter habitat phenology and climatic conditions such that habitat availability may be significantly reduced (D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;in litt.</span>&#160;2007). The species is also threatened by disturbance, Psittacine beak and feather disease and illegal bird capture and trade (D. Saunders&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Furthermore, the species seems to be very susceptible to Allee effects, where survival and reproductive success decline with decreasing population density, which might even accelerate the population decline (Crates <em>et al</em>. 2017).","Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2011) estimate that the current population probably contains around 2,000 mature individuals and is declining. It is placed in the band 1,000-2,499 mature individuals.","This species&#160;breeds in Tasmania, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Australia</span>, mostly along the south-eastern coast from St Helen's to Southport with a small breeding population in the north near Deloraine. After breeding, birds disperse throughout Tasmania before migrating north to mainland Australia. In most years, a large portion of the population winters in central Victoria, with a smaller number of birds wintering further afield (D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2007). However during periods of extreme drought in central Victoria, Swift Parrots undertake large-scale movements (up to 1,000 km) to drought refuge habitats in wetter coastal areas of New South Wales (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Small flocks are recorded in Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory on a regular basis (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). The range in South Australia appears to have contracted, with only irregular recent records of small flocks or individual birds from the south-east of the state. Population size and trends are poorly known.<br/><br/>In 1987-1988, the breeding population was estimated at 5,000 birds, including 1,320 breeding pairs, and in 1995-1996, at 940 breeding pairs (Brereton 1996). Annual surveys across the non-breeding range fluctuate depending on the distribution of the birds across the landscape and flock sizes (Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011). In 2010 mainland surveys recorded 2,158 birds, including immatures, the highest count for many years (C. Tzaros and D. Ingwersen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2010). Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2011) estimate that the population probably contains around 2,000 mature individuals and is declining, however a population viability analysis model predicted that the population will decline by an average of 87% (79-95%) over three generations (12-18 years) (Heinsohn&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).<p></p>",,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II.<strong> </strong>Management actions completed or underway include regular population surveys in Tasmania and throughout the mainland range, utilising a large network of volunteers (Saunders<em> et al</em>. 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong> (coordinated by the Swift Parrot Recovery Team and the Threatened Bird Network), addition of areas of critical habitat to the conservation reserve system in Victoria, development and refinement of guidelines for forestry in <em>E. globulus</em> and box-ironbark forests (at identified priority sites), development of community awareness programmes and revegetation and habitat rehabilitation.

On Maud Island it uses areas with a high canopy cover and low understory and ground cover (Ortiz-Catedral 2012). It requires mature trees with natural hollows or cavities for nesting. Monitoring has revealed that 80% of nests are in mature living trees, with the remaining 20% in dead trees (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2012)<strong></strong>. Of those nests found in mature trees, 68% are in red beech <em>Nothofagus fusca</em>.<em> </em>Breeding is linked with the irregular seeding of <em>Nothofagus</em> when numbers can increase substantially, and it seems that populations may fluctuate significantly in line with breeding/seeding events (T. Greene <em>in litt. </em>2016). In mast years, many pairs will lay a second clutch, and some may lay a third clutch, with breeding continuing through the austral winter. First clutches may average more than eight eggs, with second clutches averaging over seven in 2011. A study on Maud Island has shown that birds form pairs at around seven years of age, and nest in a variety of natural cavities where beech is unavailable (J. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2011, 2012)<strong></strong>. It feeds on seeds, fruits, leaves, flowers, buds and invertebrates (Kearvell 1999, Kearvell 2013)<strong></strong>.","The impact of introduced predators, principally stoats <em>Mustela erminea</em> and rats <em>Rattus</em> spp., is likely to be the primary cause of decline (Higgins 1999)<strong></strong>, with recent population crashes being due to rat irruptions. The species's hole-nesting behaviour leads to a reduced ratio of females in the population due to predation of birds on the nest (Elliott <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. Silviculture of beech forests aims to harvest trees at an age when few will be mature enough to develop suitable cavities, so sufficient nest holes are unlikely in managed beech forest (Kearwell 2002)<strong></strong>. The species forages in low-growing shrubs and such lower forest levels have been subject to heavy browsing by cattle, deer and possums, altering the forest structure (Duncan and van Hal 2004)<strong></strong>. The population on Chalky Island may suffer competition from&#160;Yellow-crowned Parakeet&#160;<em>C. auriceps </em>(J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2011) and in time, this problem may affect other island populations. Population growth in island populations, especially on Maud Island, may also be limited through predation by falcons (Falconidae), and displacement of two nesting pairs by introduced Common Starlings <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sturnus vulgaris</span> has now been documented; the overall impact of this recently-identified threat is uncertain, but may be minimal (J. C. Kearvell<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2012, 2013). <br/><br/>In 2008, it was confirmed that native Red-crowned Parakeets <em>C. novaezelandiae</em> on Little Barrier Island were suffering from psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD). The virus has been sequenced and appears very similar to the strain found in Crimson Rosella <em>Platycercus elegans</em>, in which the disease is known to be endemic within the captive population. In 2009, some individuals of <em>C. malherbi</em> on Maud Island were showing some symptoms consistent with PBFD. In reaction, testing of the entire captive population has been undertaken, as well as more limited sampling of individuals in all three island populations, as well as other parrot species. Results indicate that antibodies for PBFD were detected in <em>C. malherbi</em> from both Maud Island and the captive-rearing unit; notably in the latter case antibodies were found in the <em>C. novaezelandiae</em> foster parents (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2011), and the disease has now been found in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. auriceps</span> in the Eglington Valley, Fiordland (J. C. Kearvell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012, 2013).

Individuals&#160;<span lang=""EN-NZ"">at all three mainland sites and on Tuhua were seen to be in very poor feather condition in 2012/2013, with a major infestation of <span lang=""EN-NZ""><em>Dermanyssus </em>mites having occurred on Tuhua. On the mainland, mites were suspected but <span lang=""EN-NZ""><span lang=""EN-NZ"">immunosuppression may also be involved, either because of small population size and/or because of post PBFD issues (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt. </em>2013).<br/></span></span>","Although the population numbered several hundreds prior to 2000, a prolific increase in the population of rats and stoats within its restricted South Island range induced a rapid population decline and the total population has remained well below its previous levels. Successful translocations on four islands have boosted the population of this species, but decreases may have continued on the mainland. Overall, the global population was estimated at&#160;<span lang=""EN-NZ"">290-690  individuals in early 2013, with the mainland populations estimated to  total 130-270 individuals and the island populations totaling 160-420  individuals&#160;(J. C. Kearvell&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2013).&#160;Obtaining accurate population estimates is extremely challenging for the species, but recent counts indicate that the mainland population may have declined to around 100 birds, and the offshore island populations to around 250 birds in total (J.C. Kearvell <em>in litt. </em>2016). The population has a skewed sex ratio of males to females, probably due to higher predation on incubating females (Kearvell and Farley 2016).","Formerly occurring throughout <strong>New Zealand, </strong>the species&#160;is now known from only three beech (<em>Nothofagus </em>spp.) forest valleys in the South Island: the Hawdon and Poulter valleys in ArthurÃ¢ÂÂs Pass National Park and the South Branch of the Hurunui valley in Lake Sumner Forest Park.&#160;They are patchily distributed within these valleys; absent in many parts but in some places can be quite common (Kearvell 2013). In 1999-2000, the population crashed from perhaps 500-700 birds to a  rough estimate of 100-200 as a result of ship rat irruptions in two  successive summers (<strong></strong>J. van Hal <em>in litt. </em>2008, 2009)<strong></strong>. <br/>Translocations to islands began in 2005, with 68 individuals now released on Maud and 61 individuals on Blumine Islands in the Marlborough Sounds, 46 individuals on Chalky Island in Fiordland, and 95 individuals on Tuhua/Mayor Island in the Bay of Plenty (J.C Kearvell <em>in litt. </em>2013, A. Grant <em>in litt. </em>2016). These releases all appeared highly successful at first with positive  signs of breeding and population establishment - however, population  growth has now slowed on all islands and the persistence of these  populations appears to still be tenuous (A. Grant <em>in litt. </em>2016). Releases of&#160;captive-raised birds to the South Branch of the Hurunui to augment the population in 2015 and 2016 appear to have been successful with released birds having successfully paired and 9-10 nests located in 2016 (J. Kearvell <em>in litt. </em>2016,&#160;A. Grant <em>in litt. </em>2016). Overall, the population appears to stabilize at low levels, and it is likely that the mainland populations remains at an extremely low level of around 100 birds in total (J. Kearvell <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/><br/><span lang=""EN-NZ"">&#160;<br/><p></p><span lang=""EN-NZ""></span>",,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II (1981). Hawdon and Poulter valleys are located within Arthur's Pass National Park and the Hurunui South Branch is in Lake Sumner Conservation Park (<strong></strong>J. van Hal <em>in litt. </em>2008, 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Monitoring and conservation of this species is problematic given the difficulty in separating it from <em>C. auriceps</em>. The Hurunui population is contained within a ""mainland island"" which aims to protect and restore two river valleys through integrated pest management, including minimising numbers of <em>Mustela erminea </em>and <em>Rattus rattus</em>. Monitoring of nests will verify whether this is allowing numbers to stabilise and expand. The Hawdon population received <em>M. erminea</em> control only during plague years, which occur, on average, every four years (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. However, following the dramatic decline in the parakeet population after failure to effectively control predators, rat poisoning and stoat trapping are more extensive within the Hurunui ""mainland island"" (Keey 2004)<strong></strong>. All three valleys are now part of the ""Battle for our Birds"" initiative targeting rats and stoats in South Island beech forest sites. The control of <em>M. erminea </em>is now continuous, whereas control measures against rats are implemented when populations reach trigger points (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2011, 2013)<strong></strong>. Every nest found is also individually protected with tin tree wraps (to prevent access by predators), ground predator traps and possum traps (<strong></strong>J. van Hal <em>in litt. </em>2008, 2009), and since 2003 only one nest out of 153 has been lost to invasive predators (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt. </em>2013)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. <br/><br/>Since 2003, the captive facility at Isaacs Construction Wildlife Centre, Peacock Springs (Christchurch), has released, in conjunction with Department of Conservation, a total of over 250 individuals&#160;(J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2012)<strong></strong>. Since 2005, individuals have been translocated to Chalky Island in Fiordland, which is free from predators (Duncan and van Hal 2004)<strong></strong>. The reintroduction of birds to Maud Island has been underway since 2007, and wild-bred birds are now nesting on the island. Translocations to Tuhua Island have been taking place since December 2009, and in early 2011 it was expected that all birds produced in the next captive breeding season would be released there to provide a sufficient founder population (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2011)<strong></strong>. Translocations have also been carried out on Blumine  Island (J. C.&#160; Kearvell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). A second captive-breeding group was being set up at Mount Bruce but has been discontinued due to a lack of capacity (J. C. Kearvell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2013). Another attempt to set up a second captive breeding population has been initiated with the Auckland Zoo with the hope that a 5th island population will be started on Rotoroa Island (T. Greene <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;A study to assess the genetic diversity of the remnant mainland population, with the aim of ensuring that any new founder populations on islands are as genetically diverse as possible, has been completed (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt. </em>2013). An analysis of breeding data is also due to be started. A comprehensive testing programme for Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) in parrots throughout New Zealand was initiated (T.

Reasons for this recent decline are unclear, though the species has suffered from previous loss, fragmentation and degradation of winter habitat, and changes to fire regime in the breeding habitat. Likely causes of the recent decline are an outbreak of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease in 2014 and the effects of a ten-year drought on productivity of saltmarsh plants in the winter habitat that reduced the breeding condition of females. It is also likely that the lack of habitat burns in the preferred breeding habitat has reduced the availability and quality of preferred food plants. The species is therefore classified as Critically Endangered.<p></p>","The Orange-bellied Parrot breeds in a mosaic of eucalypt forest and rainforest bordering extensive moorland plains. Nesting occurs in tree hollows and the species feeds on the seeds of a range of grasses and sedges in moorlands. There is some evidence that early in the breeding season birds prefer to forage in areas burnt seven to 15 years earlier, whilst later in the breeding season they prefer areas burnt three to five years earlier (Garnett <em>et al.</em> 2011). After breeding, Orange-bellied Parrots migrate to saltmarshes, dunes, beaches, pastures and shrublands close to the coast (&lt;5 km), where there they feed on the ground or in low vegetation, almost exclusively on seeds, mainly of salt-tolerant coastal and saltmarsh plants (Loyn<em> et al</em>. 1986, Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011).<br/><p></p>","The primary reason for the species's rarity is thought to be its specialist habitat requirements, and fragmentation and degradation of winter habitat by grazing, agriculture and urban and industrial development. Changes have also occurred in the breeding habitat, where there has been reduction of fire, which would normally produce favourable habitat structure for the species. Up until the 1990s, fire was regularly used by small-scale tin miners to reduce vegetation cover to aid mining and protect assets, coincidentally producing high quality foraging habitat for the species. Management of the area is now subject to stricter use of fire by the land manager and due to a combination of lack of resources and risk aversion, habitat management burns have rarely been implemented. This has resulted in a gradual decline in the habitat quality for the species. Disease is an important threat to the tiny population. An outbreak of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) in 2015 infected 19 out of 26 wild Orange-bellied Parrot nestlings tested (Anon. 2015). One adult also tested positive for the disease. This contributed to a decline in the wild population from 35 to 23 mature individuals in 2016. Competition with introduced seed-eating finches may have affected winter food availability, while some former breeding habitat may have been vacated because of a change in the fire regime and competition with introduced Common Starlings <em>Sturnus vulgaris</em>, which fill nest-hollows with nesting material, rendering them unsuitable. The introduced Sugar Glider <em>Petaurus breviceps</em> is also implicated as a predator of incubating females, eggs and nestlings during the Birch's Inlet release and is a known threat to other species including the Swift Parrot (Stojanovic <em>et al</em>. 2014). Sugar Gliders are absent from Melaleuca and therefore may have had an influence on the contraction of the breeding range. Deaths from random events, such as predation by foxes and cats, or disease, are significant threats to such a tiny population. Ongoing degradation of remaining saltmarsh habitat on the mainland is a significant threat (C. Tzaros and M.A. Weston <em>in litt. </em>2003). A ten-year drought reduced productivity of saltmarsh plants in the winter habitat, reducing the breeding condition of females.&#160;Windfarm developments may kill about one bird per year (Smales <em>et al. </em>2005). Due to the low population size, the species is highly susceptible to genetic Allee effects, which might lead to further population reductions (Crates <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><p></p>","Surveys in early 2010 found fewer than 50 birds at Melaleuca and found no birds at any other historical breeding areas. The wild population was therefore estimated to contain fewer than 50 individuals and mature individuals in 2010.&#160;The total wild population at the end of the 2015/16 season was only 35 (M. Holdsworth <em>in litt. </em>2016) and has decreased to 14 in 2017. The sex ratio is highly skewed (12 males and 2 females) (D. Stojanovic <em>in litt.</em> 2017). Captive breeding programmes have been carried out since 1986 to restock the wild population, with more than 300 individuals in different breeding centres in Australia and Tasmania (BirdLife Australia <em>in litt</em>. 2016).","This species breeds only in south-western Tasmania, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Australia</span>. The current known breeding population is only found at one small site, at Melaleuca, but the historical distribution was more extensive and unsuccessful attempts were made to re-establish&#160;a population at BirchÃ¢ÂÂs Inlet.&#160;Birds migrate to the mainland after breeding, sometimes stopping over on King Island, and overwintering at coastal sites in south-eastern South Australia and Victoria. Annual winter counts in Victoria, South Australia and Bass Strait from 1979 to 1990 varied between 67 and 122, with no significant change in numbers (Starks <em>et al.</em> 1992). Numbers recorded in mainland surveys have since declined, for example 48 birds recorded from 19 sites in 2007 (Saunders 2008). The overall population, which was estimated to number around 150 individuals in 2005 (M. Holdsworth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2005), has since undergone a rapid decline (confirmed by data from both breeding and wintering sites): surveys in early 2010 found fewer than 50 birds at Melaleuca and no birds at any other historical breeding areas (Sims 2010). The wild population was therefore estimated to contain fewer than 50 individuals in 2010, and extinction in the wild has been predicted to take place within 3-5 years (Sims 2010). More recently, the total post-breeding wild population at Melaleuca was only 35, including 18 juveniles (M. Holdsworth <em>in litt. </em>2016). Based on mean annual survival estimates (Holdsworth <em>et al.</em> 2011) the return of mature individuals in 2016/17 was predicted to be 20-25. Low breeding participation of females appears to be a limiting factor in some years, with some females not breeding every year (Sims 2010).&#160;Only 12 and 13 young are known to have fledged at Melaleuca in 2008/09 and 2009/10 respectively, and urgent action was taken in 2010/11 to secure the captive population by the collection of 21 of 27 young as founders in that year (Garnett <em>et al.</em> 2011). In recent years the output of fledglings has recovered somewhat with an average of 25/year (14-39/year). The captive insurance population has expanded in recent years and by April 2016 consisted of about 325 individuals held at ten facilities under a cooperative breeding programme and is considered to be secure (A. Everaardt <em>in litt. 2</em>016). Re-establishment of the Orange-bellied Parrot at Birch's Inlet was attempted during the period 1999-2009 with a total of 410 captive-bred birds being released, which produced 71 wild-bred fledglings. However, the reintroduction attempt failed because mean annual adult survival of released birds was 0.30 - half that of wild birds (0.65) - and the low fertility rate of 0.55 mimics the low fertility of the captive population (0.57), which is significantly less than in wild birds (0.86). Breeding output at this site was further limited by nest competition and depredation.&#160;<p></p>",,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I. A recovery team was established in 1980, a wide range of research projects are ongoing, and awareness-raising and education programmes are conducted. Much feeding habitat in Tasmania (including King Island), Victoria and South Australia has been reserved or is managed. Breeding, migration and winter counts are made annually, and almost 100% of the wild population is colour-banded. A captive breeding programme has been established and the population of about 350 birds is held at 10 institutions under a cooperative captive breeding effort. The captive population is predominantly derived from six founders collected in the 1980s (perhaps leading to low egg fertility as a result of inbreeding depression) but more recently has been bolstered by the inclusion of 21 new founders collected in 2010. Captive-bred birds that have been released have apparently migrated successfully between their breeding and wintering grounds (Loyn <em>et al. </em>2005, Anon. 2014), but few birds released on the breeding grounds return in the following breeding season (Troy and Gales&#160;2016), suggesting that most released birds fail to migrate or survive to the following year. As the population is severely male biased (six males per one female), a higher proportion of females is released in spring to correct the sex ratio  imbalance (Stojanovic et al. 2017). The survival rate and reproductive success of captive-reared birds are far lower&#160;than for wild birds (Holdsworth 2006, Holdsworth <em>et al.</em> 2011, Stojanovic <em>et al</em>. 2017). Moreover, the plumage of captive-bred birds is in poorer condition, which might prove to be energetically costly, especially during migration (Stojanovic<em> et al</em>. 2017). Of &#160;53 captive birds released in 2014 and 2015, just six survived to return to Melaleuca. An additional 27 captive bred individuals were released at Melaleuca in 2015. The behaviour of released birds has been monitored, and differs in many respects from those of wild parrots (Penrose 2016). <br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Survey all saltmarsh in wintering range using satellite imagery. Monitor genetic heterozygosity. Model breeding and feeding habitat to assess availability. Re-establish saltmarsh in areas where it is likely to benefit the species. Monitor and manage Psittacine Circoviral Disease in the captive population. Control human disturbance at Victorian sites and Melaleuca, Tasmania. Control predators at mainland sites. Control feral cats at King Island site. Create new winter habitats. Protect key wintering sites in South Australia. Develop and implement a media strategy. Continue to manage wild breeding population, but revise and reduce supplementary feeding. Capture enough wild parrots to maximise genetic variability in captive population and maintain a healthy, genetically viable, captive population, increasing it to 400 individuals (Garnett&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2011, Stojanovic&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Increase the number of captive-bred birds released into the wild.

In the dry season, it frequents the canopy of tall ""terra firme"" (not flooded) forest but, in the breeding season, appears to inhabit clearings with few scattered trees. Tree-cavities are used for nesting and roosting. It feeds on fruit, berries, seeds and nuts and, seasonally, on crops (especially maize, which ripens immediately before fledging). Breeding generally occurs between December and April, but has been noted in October. Breeding is apparently communal, with several females contributing two or three eggs to each nest and several adults caring for the young. Up to nine young have been recorded in a nest in the wild, and up to 14 in captivity. <p></p>","Habitat destruction and fragmentation as a result of road construction, subsequent development and settlement, with accompanying illegal logging, are threats in the east of its range. Selective logging of primary hardwoods removes suitable roosting and nesting cavities (Yamashita 2003).<strong></strong> However, the species is not as forest-dependent as several other  non-threatened Psittacid species in the region, and it is capable of  commuting between  multiple forest-patches and moving around non-forest  landscapes (A. C. Lees <em>in litt</em>. 2013). In addition, the majority of remaining suitable habitat is not as   fragmented as originally thought and much of this is under  protection  (de Luca <em>et  al</em>. 2009). Nevertheless, projected rates of deforestation within its range, based on forecasts of infrastructure development (Soares-Filho <em>et al</em>. 2006), suggest that the species will be impacted over the coming decades (Bird <em>et al</em>. 2011). It has been extensively trapped for trade, but, although some illegal trade persists, this is no longer a major concern as trade is now usually within the substantial captive population, and does not have a significant impact on the wild population (L.

The population in this study area (a strip of c.340 km  along the TapajÃÂ³s river, western ParÃÂ¡), which encompasses no more than 5% of  the total area of suitable habitat for the species, was  estimated at 500 individuals, representing the  largest known population. A highly conservative extrapolation of 1 individual per 16 km<sup>2</sup>  across 174,000 km<sup>2</sup> of suitable habitat within the known Extent of  Occurrence gives an estimate of c.10,875 individuals (Laranjeiras  2011).

On-going declines are inferred to be taking place in the population as a  result of habitat loss, introduced predators (e.g. on New Caledonia and  Stewart Island [G. Harper <em>in litt.</em> 2005, 2012; Harper 2009]), and potentially owing to Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (Ortiz-Catedral <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The nominate subspecies is adversely affected by forestry operations: clear-felling and burning have drastically reduced available habitat, and selective logging may reduce the number of trees with suitable nesting holes and foraging opportunities. Irruptions in the 19th century may have been caused by increased cultivation of crops by European settlers. It was hunted for food by Maori, and was formerly persecuted because birds damaged crops and gardens. It may suffer through competition for food or breeding sites with introduced species (such as the Common Myna <em>Acridotheres tristis</em>, Common Starling <em>Sturnus vulgaris</em>, Eastern Rosella <em>Platycercus eximius</em>, Crimson Rosella <em>P. elegans</em>, common brushtail possums <em>Trichosurus vulpecula </em>and honey bees <em>Apis mellifera</em>). Introduced predators such as cats, rats and stoats may also impact the species. An outbreak of beak-and-feather disease has been confirmed in the population on Little Barrier Island. This has the potential to cause significant mortality, although effects on the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. novaezelandiae</span> population have not yet been studied (Ortiz-Catedral <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).<br/><br/>Subspecies <em>cookii</em> has been affected by the clearance of forests before 1950, for timber, agriculture and pasture,  severely reducing suitable habitat. Since then, increasing weed invasion  has dramatically altered the structure and composition of remaining  native vegetation. The degradation of native plant communities has been  linked with a reduction in the nutrient input to the island, caused by  the decimation of formerly large populations of burrow-nesting seabirds  by introduced mammalian predators (Holdaway in prep.). Though forest  clearance has stopped, recovery requires new habitat to become  available. Nest-site availability has been further reduced by  competition with introduced Crimson Rosella <em>Platycercus elegans</em> and, to a lesser extent, Common Starling <em>Sturnus vulgaris </em>and feral honey bees. Most known nest failures have resulted from predation by introduced black rats <em>Rattus rattus</em>.  Feral cats are also thought to be significant predators and, although  the level of predation is unquantified, anecdotal reports have been  alarming (M. Christian<em> in litt.</em> 2007). There is a high level of Psittacine Circoviral Disease (PCD) in the population, which has resulted in some mortality.<br/><br/>Subspecies <em>saisseti</em> is only common in the south of New Caledonia, in sites at risk from nickel mining, and so  may suffer significant habitat loss in the near future.

Past population estimates suggest the total population was in excess of 20,000 individuals, but historically the island populations were part of an effectively panmictic population. When the mainland linking populations became extinct, the island populations became isolated, and their effective population sizes are now much reduced. Declines are likely to be taking place on Stewart Island (by inference from measured declines of other species, owing to rat and cat predation), although any decline has been minimal (G.

It was once found throughout the island, and estimated to number at  least 190 pairs. It is now confined to the Norfolk Island National Park  and adjacent forested areas and orchards (Hill 2002). In 1994, the  declining population consisted of only four breeding females and 28-33  males.

However, recent observations of  disappearance from places where it was once common, and eviÃÂ­dence of cat  predation (M. Christian, R. Ward and J.

It has been observed from Colnett massif in the  north to the extreme south of the Goro region but it is absent from the  Ile des Pins (Chartendrault and N. BarrÃÂ© <em>in litt. </em>2007). It is  most abundant in the centre of the chain (north of La Foa to Thio and  Canala) and the southern tip of New Caledonia, and is scarce in the  north (V. Chartendrault and N.

For these reasons it qualifies as Endangered.<p></p> <p></p>,"It occurs in montane (above 500 m) humid forest enclaves in the otherwise semi-arid north-east Brazil. These wet 'sky islands' are known locally as 'brejos'. Humid forests grade into semi-deciduous forest and eventually dry, xeric caatingas in lower areas. The forests are restricted to upland granite or sandstone areas which receive up to four times the annual rainfall of lower altitudes. The humid forests atop the BaturitÃÂ© massif form a continuous canopy c.20 m tall, with some emergents. Birds feed on fruit and seeds in the canopy of humid and semi-deciduous forest.&#160;The newly discovered population of five birds on a rocky mountainside in CearÃÂ¡&#160;were found to be nesting in a fissure in the rock face; considerably different from the typical tree nest sites used by the other remaining populations (Anon. 2014).<p></p>","The principal threat to this species is believed to come from ongoing trapping for illegal local and national trade<strong></strong> (C. Albano <em>in litt</em>. 2006, Anon. 2009; GirÃÂ£o and Albano 2008) and captive-breeding (Fernandes-Ferreira <em>et al</em>. 2012). The species occurs in the international cage bird trade. However, there has been a notable decrease in the illegal capture and trade of the species, possibly as a result of the ongoing education programme (F. Nunes <em>in litt. </em>2016). &#160;Habitat destruction has played a role in the species's decline with original forest cover now reduced to just 13%. Coffee plantations (especially where sun coffee is grown instead of shade coffee) are impacting upon the species's habitat.&#160;&#160;Lack of natural nest sites, and nest predators (bees, wasps and small mammals) are also thought to be limiting the species's reproductive success (Campos&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><p></p>","The population at the BaturitÃÂ© Mountains is&#160;estimated to be 600-800 individuals, the population in QuixadÃÂ¡ is estimated at 50-60 individuals and 6 birds have been recorded at&#160;Ibaretama (F. Nunes <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). The total population is therefore estimated as 656-866 individuals (rounded here to 660-870 individuals), which roughly equates to 437-577 mature individuals, placed here in the band 250-999 mature individuals.","This species is known historically from 15 locations (F. Nunes <em>in litt. </em>2016) in&#160;<strong>Brazil</strong>. Currently it is found in just three areas in&#160;CearÃÂ¡ state: the Serra do BaturitÃÂ©, QuixadÃÂ¡ (C. Albano <em>in litt</em>. 2006, Waugh <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010) and Ibaretama. &#160;In Serra do BaturitÃÂ©  it seems to be uncommon and appears to have been extirpated from several areas; the population here is now estimated to be 600-800 birds<strong></strong> (F. Nunes <em>in litt. </em>2016). &#160;The forests of the BaturitÃÂ© Mountains have been greatly reduced to make room for shade and sun coffee and only 13% of the forest remained in 1996. However, data from the last 10 years indicate that both the size of the groups observed and the area occupied by the species in the BaturitÃÂ© Mountains are slowly increasing, likely as a result of &#160;intensive conservation management and education campaigns (F. Nunes <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). &#160;A population of c. 50 birds was discovered in QuixadÃÂ¡ in 2010 (Waugh <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010) and has recently been estimated to number 50-60 individuals (F. Nunes <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). The mostly recently discovered site is Ibaretama, where five birds were recorded in March 2014 (Anon. 2014). No more than six individuals have subsequently been documented here (F. Nunes <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). &#160;The species was formerly known from two other areas: the eastern slope of the Serra de Ibiapaba in CearÃÂ¡, and the tiny Serra Negra in Pernambuco where it was very common in 1974, with flocks of 4-6 individuals regularly seen in the early 1980s, but there are no recent records.

In central Tamaulipas it has been observed in mixed landscapes of wooded mountain slopes with adjacent mixed scrub, citrus or villages (T. Brush <em>in litt. </em>2016). Smaller numbers occur in agricultural landscapes with a few large trees. Nests are usually in tree-cavities, with breeding from March-May.

A more up-to-date estimate of the wild population is urgently required.<br/>From the spatial spread of observational records (per eBird 2021) it appears that the wild population is concentrated in three areas in north-eastern Mexico. However, particularly during the non-breeding season the species is known to move over large areas, and observational records in the intervening areas suggest that there is connectivity among the population. As such, the species is tentatively assessed as forming only one subpopulation.","<em>Amazona viridigenalis</em> is locally and seasonally fairly common to common on the Atlantic slope of north-east <strong>Mexico </strong>(Howell and Webb 1995), mostly in Tamaulipas and San Luis PotosÃÂ­, with small colonies in extreme north-east QuerÃÂ©taro (A.&#160;G.&#160;Navarro <em> in litt</em>. 1998)<strong></strong>.

First, long-term destruction of the specific gallery woodland habitat on which the species apparently depended, the result of the colonisation and exploitation of the region along the rio SÃÂ£o Francisco corridor during more than three centuries. Secondly, trapping for the illegal live bird trade in recent decades pushed the species towards extinction. In addition, the colonisation of the distributional range by introduced aggressive African bees, and the building of the Sobradinho hydroelectric dam above Juazeiro may have contributed, perhaps significantly, to the species's decline in the 1970s and 1980s. Direct hunting is considered a factor of minor importance in the overall decline (Barros <em>et. al.</em>&#160;2012), even though several reports of shooting are on record. The remaining caatinga habitat has suffered degradation and clearance as a result of grazing by cattle and goats (Barros <em>et. al.</em>&#160;2012).",The species is now considered to be Extinct in the Wild (Butchart <em>et. al.</em>&#160;2018).,"This species was known for over 150 years, from small numbers of traded birds and a hunted bird taken by von Spix, until it was traced in 1985-1986 to near the rio SÃÂ£o Francisco in north Bahia, <strong>Brazil</strong>. Only three birds remained and these were captured for trade in 1987 and 1988. However, a single male, paired with a female Blue-winged Macaw <em>Propyrrhura maracana</em>, was discovered at the site in July 1990. A female <em>C. spixii</em> was released from captivity in 1995 and initially paired with the male. Unfortunately, the female disappeared from the release site after seven weeks and is suspected to have collided with a power-line<strong></strong> (Caparroz <em>et al. </em>2001). The wild bird was still paired with the female <em>P. maracana</em> in January 2000 (Y. de Melo Barros <em>in litt.</em> 1999, 2000) but neither bird has been seen since the end of that year. In 2000, the total number of publicly declared birds in captivity was 60, but 54 of these were captive-bred (Schischakin 2000). The official captive population in 2015 totalled over 100 individuals (EcoAmericas 2015), with further individuals in private ownership. There have been occasional local reports, including from Serra da Capivara National Park, and a bird was filmed near CuraÃÂ§ÃÂ¡ in June 2016, but this is now thought to have been a release from captivity.

It is reported that the total population on Mauritius contains around 450 mature individuals. The Echo Parakeet is therefore listed as Vulnerable under Criterion D1.<p></p>","This species now survives in forest and upland scrub (Marshall 1997)<strong></strong>, with lowland, intermediate and scrub forests being very important feeding areas (Jones 1987)<strong></strong>. It appears to be a strictly arboreal forager, feeding mainly on native plants and taking a wide range of parts including buds, young shoots, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, twigs and even bark and sap (Jones 1987, Jones <em>et al</em>. 2013)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. They return to favoured food trees, some of which have been used for generations (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. Birds forage singly or in small groups in different areas at different seasons and are known to travel several kilometers to and from feeding areas in search of food, although the dwarf forest and scrublands of the south-west plateau are an important foraging area throughout the year (Jones 1987)<strong></strong>. Nesting takes place in natural cavities in native trees (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong>. It is monogamous, but breeding units in the 1970s and 1980s often comprised a group of one female with up to three males, one of which was dominant and mated with and fed the female (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. The presence of extra males was probably the result of a formerly skewed sex ratio; pairs are usually hostile to extra males, who seem to have no positive effect on fledging success, which is probably related to the experience of the dominant male (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. Clutch size is 1-4 (but normally 2-3) eggs, which are laid from September-December (Thorsen and Jones 1998<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">, </span><strong></strong> Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>, and incubation, by the female, lasts 21-25 days (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. The population currently experiences high rates of egg fertility (84%), high hatchability of fertile eggs (82%) and fledging success of hatched young (76%) (Jones<em> et al</em>. 2013). One to two chicks are usually fledged, though up to four have been recorded (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998, 2013)<strong></strong> from the end of October to the beginning of February or later, and fledgling parakeets are reputed to stay with their parents, being fed by them for at least 2-3 months after leaving the nest (Jones 1987)<strong></strong>.&#160;<p></p>","This species's earlier decline and contracting distribution corresponds to the severe destruction and degradation of its native habitat (Jones 1987, Greenwood 1996<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The population crashed from a likely total of several thousand following forest destruction and the replacement of its favoured feeding habitat, upland dwarf forest, with plantations (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. In 1996, only 5% of the island was covered with native vegetation (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. The areas of upland native forest that remain continue to be highly degraded by cyclones, the influences of past forestry practices, the spread of introduced plants such as guava <em>Psidium cattleianum</em>, privet <em>Ligustrum robustum</em> and jamrosa <em>Syzygium jambos</em> and the effect of introduced feral mammals such as pigs <em>Sus scrofa</em> and rusa deer <em>Rusa timorensis</em> (Greenwood 1996<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">,</span> Thorsen and Jones 1998)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The production of native fruit, on which the parakeet feeds, and regeneration of potential nest trees is thus poor (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong>. Recent research suggests that food shortage due to deterioration of the native forest is the major cause of nest failure; although exotics can provide an abundant food source it is not available year-round or even throughout the breeding season (Thorsen and Jones 1998)<strong></strong>. Crab-eating macaques <em>Macaca fascicularis</em> and black rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> are amongst a number of introduced arboreal species which pose a threat to parakeets by raiding nests and competing for native fruits (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong>. Bees <em>Apis mellifera</em>, yellow wasps <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Polistes hebraeus</span>, paper wasps, termites,<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>White-tailed Tropicbirds <em>Phaethon lepturus</em>, introduced Common Mynas <em>Acridotheres tristis</em> and Ring-necked Parakeets <em>Psittacula krameri</em> are all nest site competitors and can displace active breeding pairs (Thorsen and Jones 1998<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">, </span><strong></strong> C. Jones <em>in litt.</em> 2000, V. Tatayah <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012)<strong></strong>. The decline in the number of old native trees, which are lost to storm damage and senescence, has intensified competition for nesting cavities, with 14-19% of <em>P. eques</em> cavities lost to competitors each year (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. Infestations of nest fly larvae can be severe in some years and, without intervention, would kill many young (C. Jones <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. Despite the rapid outbreak of a novel genotype of the virus that causes Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) in the 2004/2005 season (Kundu&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), the impact of the disease on the population appears to have been thus far negligible, limited to a brief reduction in hatching success (Tollington&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).<p></p>","At the end of the 2016/2017 breeding season, the population was estimated at c.756 birds. The number of mature individuals in the 2018/2019 breeding season was estimated as approximately 450 individuals (S. Henshaw and V. Tatayah <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2019).","<em>Psittacula eques</em> survives in south-west <strong>Mauritius</strong>, having become extinct historically on <strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">RÃÂ©union.&#160;</strong>Once widespread across Mauritius, numbers started to decline in the 19<sup>th</sup> century to an estimated 20 individuals in the 1980s (Jones <em>et al.</em> 2013, V. Tatayah and S. Henshaw <em>in litt</em>. 2019). The speciesÃ¢ÂÂs decline and contracting distribution was likely caused by the severe and large-scale destruction and degradation of its forest habitat for conversion into plantations (Jones 1987, Greenwood 1996, Jones<em> et al.</em> 1998).&#160;<br/><br/>Since then, intense conservation efforts have aided the continuous recovery of the species (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2013). By now, the largest part of the population is confined to restricted areas of the Black River Gorges National Park (6,800 ha) in southwestern Mauritius. Reintroductions of captive-bred birds there ceased in 2005/2006 (C. Jones <em>in litt</em>. 2019), following the outbreak of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD). Currently, two additional populations are being established in other parts of Mauritius: between 2015 and 2017, wild-born individuals were translocated to the Bambous Mountains on the East Coast of the island, where breeding could be confirmed in 2018, and this population is deemed self-sustaining (V. Tatayah, S. Henshaw and C. Jones <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Another translocation programme started in early 2018 to establish a population in Chamarel in the south-west; however this population has not been breeding yet (V. Tatayah and S. Henshaw <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Translocations to both Bambous and Chamarel are planned to continue in the next few years to reinforce the population (V. Tatayah <em>in litt</em>. 2019).<strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">&#160;</strong><p></p>",,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>The species has been the subject of a conservation programme since 1973 (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. The dramatic increase in the species's population in recent years is undoubtedly due to an intensive programme to manage the wild population combined with a highly successful captive breeding programme since the 1993/1994 breeding season (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong> - a collaborative effort of  the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation, the World Parrot Trust, the Mauritian Government and the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust Society (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Between 1997 and 2004, when reintroductions were completed, a total of 139 captive reared birds were released (Jones 2010). Clutch and brood manipulations of wild nests were carried out between 1994 and 2005 to increase productivity and obtain individuals for captive breeding (Jones <em>et al.</em> 2013). The intensity of conservation management was reduced in 2005 to reduce the risk of the spread of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2013). Current conservation management measures are more hands-off and directed towards maximising wild survival and recruitment (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013). Nest cavity improvement is carried out to address a shortage in the availability of quality natural breeding sites. This involves modifications to protect against weather, competitors, and predators (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013). Nest parasites (nest flies and mites) are controlled via the addition of pesticide-treated substrate. Artificial nest boxes were first used for breeding in 2000, with uptake steadily increasing since. The majority of breeding pairs nested in artificial nest boxes in the 2010/2011 breeding season, and productivity was higher at these sites compared with natural cavities (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013). Supplementary feeding in the form of commercially produced parrot pellets was provided consistently since 1997, and as of the 2010/2011 season was consumed by over 50% of the population. Consumption of supplementary food is associated with the production of larger clutches, more eggs hatched per clutch, and more individuals fledged per brood (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;Habitat management has been directed at increasing the productivity of native forest and has included the foundation in 1993 of the Black River National Park in 6,574 ha of native forest (Jones and Hartley 1995, Greenwood 1996), including most of the species's remaining habitat (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. There are 14 Conservation Management Areas (CMAs), ranging from 0.2 to 24 ha, in which native forest is manually cleared of weeds (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. Some of these CMAs are heavily utilised by the species as their trees produce bumper crops (C. Jones <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>.&#160;Research has occurred on present and historic genetic variation of the species so that the effects of the population bottleneck can be quantified and current populations managed to preserve maximum genetic diversity (Tollington <em>et al. </em>2013)<strong></strong>. Research into the impact of PBFD is likely to be ongoing for several years (Malham 2007), and has involved intensive screening of birds since 2005 (Richards 2010, V. Tatayah <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012)<strong></strong>. Despite the rapid outbreak of a novel genotype of the causative virus in the 2004/2005 season (Kundu <em>et al</em>. 2012), the impact of the disease on the population appears to have been thus far negligible, limited to a brief reduction in hatching success (Tollington <em>et al</em>. 2015). Strict biosecurity protocols are deployed by conservation managers to restrict transmission of disease. An experiment testing the effectiveness of these protocols&#160; has suggested that while they reduced the probability of nestling infection, they were in fact associated with a slight reduction in fledging success (Fogell <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;Recently, wild-born individuals were translocated to the Bambous Mountains on the east coast of Mauritius to establish a new population. Breeding was confirmed there in the 2018/2019 season (S. Henshaw <em>in litt. </em>2019).&#160;Another translocation programme was started in early 2018 to establish a population in Chamarel in the south-west; no breeding has yet been recorded there (V. Tatayah and S. Henshaw <em>in litt.</em> 2019).<br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>Translocations to both Bambous and Chamarel are planned to continue in the next few years to reinforce the population (V. Tatayah <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Establishment of a population on RÃÂ©union, where the species formerly occurred and suitable habitat exists, has been suggested&#160;(Jones <em>et al. </em>2013)<strong></strong>. Current management practices such as of the provision of artificial nest boxes and supplementary food are likely to be long-term requirements of the population while remaining native forest is rehabilitated (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013, Jones <em>in litt </em>2019). Research into the effectiveness and consequences of these management practices, as well as the impacts of PBFD, will continue (Jones <em>in litt. </em>2019).&#160;<br/><p></p>","(Boddaert, 1783)"

Maisels <em>in litt.</em> 2006; H. Rainey <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. From 1982 to 2001, over 1.3 million wild-caught individuals of both <span style=""font-style: italic;"">erithacus </span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">timneh</span> (the vast majority <span style=""font-style: italic;"">erithacus</span>) entered international trade (UNEP-WCMC 2016), and considering the pre-trade mortality can be 30-66% (Fotso 1998a, b; McGowan 2001; Hart 2013), the number collected could far exceed this figure (Martin <em>et al. </em>2014; R. Martin <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). During 1984 Ã¢ÂÂ 1992, more than 50,000 individual wild birds were traded annually (UNEP-WCMC 2016). In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Cameroon exported an annual quota of 10,000 birds; estimates that c.90% of trapped birds died before reaching Douala airport suggest that some 100,000 birds per year were being captured in Cameroon during that period (F. Dowsett-Lemaire <em>in litt. </em>2012).  Official statistics give exports of 367,166 individuals from Cameroon in the period 1981-2005, and the country accounted for 48% of exports between 1990-1996 (Waugh 2010).&#160;Up to 10,000 wild-caught birds from the Democratic Republic of the Congo  are apparently imported into South Africa each year (S. Boyes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2011).&#160;There has been a reduction in the trade of this species, partly due to extra trade restrictions, but also due to population declines, which leads collectors to move onto populations previously not harvested (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016). The majority of legal exports are now from central Africa, and difficulties regulating trade mean that quotas have been regularly exceeded (CITES 2016). In addition, illegal international trafficking occurs but levels are difficult to quantify (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/>Because the species concentrates in traditional nesting, roosting, drinking and mineral lick sites, it is especially vulnerable to trapping pressure. Habitat loss is undoubtedly having significant impacts, particularly throughout West and East Africa. In addition to capture for international trade, there is an active internal trade in live birds for pets and exhibition (McGowan 2001; Clemmons 2003; A. Michels <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). The species is also hunted in parts of the range as bushmeat and to supply heads, legs and tail feathers for use as medicine or in black magic (Fotso 1998a; McGowan 2001; Clemmons 2003; A. Michels <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). Forest loss is also negatively impacting populations, and is considered to have contributed to declines in Ghana and may be a larger threat than the pet trade in Cameroon (Tamungang and Cheke 2012; Annorbah <em>et al.</em> 2016). The loss of large trees with nesting cavities may be particularly detrimental. Although some observers have noted populations are associated with primary forest (D<span class=""page_assessment_classScheme_content"">ÃÂ¤ndliker 1992a; Juste 1996; <span class=""page_assessment_classScheme_content""><span class=""page_assessment_classScheme_content"">Clemmons 2003), permanent populations in semi-urban areas, and its frequent use of farm-bush, plantations and secondary forest suggest this species may be robust to some habitat change (Tamungang and Cheke 2012; R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2014).</span>","Using density estimates for the now-split <span style=""font-style: italic;"">P. timneh </span>(4.9-6.0 birds/km<sup>2</sup>; Fotso 1998a; McGowan 2001), the West African population of <em>P. erithacus</em> is estimated at 40,000-100,000 birds, although central African populations of this species are much larger. The population in Principe is now estimated to be 6,000-8,000 individuals, equivalent to population densities as high as 55-63 birds/km<sup>2</sup>. Using a global land cover classification, a digitised map of the species's range from Benson <em>et al.</em> (1988), and estimates of density 0.15-0.45 birds/km<sup>2</sup> in semi-deciduous forest (including deciduous forest) and 0.3-6.0 birds/km<sup>2</sup> in evergreen forest (including swamp forest and mangrove), supplemented by post-1995 published national estimates where available, an initial coarse assessment of the global population of <em>P. erithacus</em> is 0.56-12.7 million individuals.","<em>Psittacus erithacus</em> has a distribution extending from southeastern <strong>CÃÂ´te d'Ivoire</strong> east through the moist lowland forests of West Africa to <strong>Cameroon</strong>, and thence in the Congo forests to just east of the Albertine Rift (up to the shores of Lake Victoria) in <strong>Uganda</strong>,&#160;<strong>Kenya</strong>&#160;and <strong>Tanzania</strong>, and south to northern <strong>Angola </strong>(Juniper and Parr 1998), as well as on the islands <span class=""page_assessment_classScheme_content""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sao TomÃÂ© and Principe </span>(Jones and Tye 2006)&#160;and Bioko (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Equatorial Guinea</span>). Preliminary calculations based on forest cover and country-level population estimates (<strong></strong>DÃÂ¤ndliker 1992a, b; Collar 1997; <strong></strong>Fotso 1998a)<strong></strong>, subtracting estimates for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">P. timneh</span>, suggest a global population of between 560,000 and 12.7 million individuals (Pilgrim <em>et al. </em>in prep.)<strong></strong>.

From 1982 to 2014, over 1.3 million wild-caught individuals of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">P. erithacus </span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">P. timneh</span> (the vast majority <em>P.</em> <span style=""font-style: italic;"">erithacus</span>) entered international trade (UNEP-WCMC 2016). Considering estimates of pre-export mortality, and illegal trade, the number of birds extracted from the wild during this period may have exceeded this. Cameroon accounted for 48% of exports from 1990-1996 (Waugh 2010), and estimates that c.90% of trapped birds died before reaching Douala airport suggest, although quotas remained at 12,000, over 100,000 birds were being captured in Cameroon annually during this period (F. Dowsett-Lemaire <em>in litt. </em>2012).<span class=""page_assessment_classScheme_content""><span class=""page_assessment_classScheme_content""></span></span>",,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>As a result of concerns about international trade, <em>Psittacus erithacus princeps</em> was put on CITES Appendix I in 1975, and the remainder of the species was put on CITES Appendix II with all Psittaciformes in 1981 at the request of Switzerland and Liechtenstein. In 1994, the <em>P. e. princeps</em> CITES listing was removed due to lack of evidence that it is a valid subspecies. Due to concern about the effects of the large numbers of this species traded, it was the subject of a CITES significant trade review, in which it was listed as of ""possible concern"" (Inskipp <em>et al.</em> 1988)<strong></strong>. The Animals Committee of CITES recommended a two-year ban from January 2007 in Cameroon. There have been multiple CITES Reviews of Significant Trade of this species, and together with additional trade restrictions this has resulted in reductions in international trade of this species (R. Martin <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016) and the species has now been moved to CITES Appendix I (S. Chng <em>in litt. </em>2016; Dueker <em>et al.</em> 2019). Only Cameroon has a published export quota (currently 3000 per annum) (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016). Until January 2016, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had a quota of 5,000 per annum, but this quota was not kept to and many people traded using false permits (CITES 2016).&#160;Monitoring of exploited areas and trapping sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in addition to outreach initiatives led by the provincial government has resulted in the protection of some of this species's largest breeding areas (Hart <em>et al.</em> 2016; R.

This involved trials of monitoring parrot populations and trade, while it also developed a framework for the establishment of national management plans of this species (R. Martin <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). The species occurs in a number of protected areas.<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Establish institutional structures for regulation of trade and scientifically robust methods for establishing non-detrimental levels of exploitation (R.

Anecdotal information and small-scale studies have indicated a population decline. For these reasons, the species is listed as Near Threatened.","The species is found in a variety of habitats including scrub (in the Cerrado and Chaco), savanna, palm groves, gallery forest, subtropical woodland and urban areas (Schunk&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Collar <em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). It nests in cavities in large trees and therefore requires old-growth areas (Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). In winter in Argentina, it occupies yungas forest and particularly stands of <em>Anadenanthera macrocarpa&#160;</em>(Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). It feeds on fruit and seeds of a wide variety of plants including&#160;<em>Melia</em>,<em> Aspidosperma</em>,<em> Prosopis</em>,<em> Schinopsis</em>,&#160;<em>Ziziphus</em>, <em>Citrus</em>, <em>Anadenanthera</em>, <em>Bulnesia</em> and <em>Cercidium</em>&#160;as well as cactus fruit and palm fruit and seeds (Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). It also feeds on maize and sunflower crops (Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). It nests in holes in trees or occasionally cliff faces or arboreal termite nests (Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). It is largely resident, with most of the Chaco population in Argentina migrating to the eastern foothills of the Andes over winter (Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). It roosts communally in trees.","Expert opinion of six studied populations indicated that the main threats to the species are agro-industry farming, wood and pulp plantations, agro-industry grazing, capture for the pet trade (local and international), large-scale and selective logging and climate change (Berkunsky <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017a).<br/><br/>The species is very heavily trapped for the cage-bird trade, but the impact on populations is not known. Minimum net exports rose from 10,600 in 1981 to 58,500 in 1988, but declined after that (Collar <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Large numbers of individuals continue to be traded illegally within countries (Pires <em>et al. </em>2016, Ortiz-von Halle 2018).&#160;Hundreds of individuals are captured in Brazil every year and nesting sites are frequently destroyed, with many traded between states, and the species is commonly received by government wildlife rehabilitation centres (Schunk&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). Data shows that 1,200 individuals were seized by or handed to authorities between 2004 and 2006 (COEFA/IBAMA 2008), although this figure is considered to be an underestimate of the true number of Turquoise-fronted Amazons seized and an additional 503 individuals were received by a state wildlife rehabilitation during the same period (ICMBio 2010). In Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, Turquoise-fronted Amazon is the species most frequently rescued by the authorities (Seixas and Mourao 2000); around 6,500 nestlings were seized by the environmental enforcement agencies since 1988 (900 in 2008 alone), and it is estimated that the total number of birds poached from the wild is two-three times higher (Blue-fronted Amazon Project n.d.). According to J. Tella <em>in litt.</em>&#160;(2015), 30,000 birds are captured annually. In Argentina, the National Fauna Authority coordinated the capture of more than 20,000 nestlings and 5,400 adults from the Chaco forest between 1998 and 2012, based on quotas derived from the number of individuals believed to die of natural causes (Berkunsky <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017b). However, a study by&#160;Berkunsky<em> et al.</em> (2017b) found that harvested individuals are generally removed from nests at a later stage than that when much of the natural mortality occurs, meaning that harvested parrots largely do not represent individuals that would otherwise have died of natural causes. A survey of a major illegal wildlife market in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, recorded 1,296 individuals being traded across 2005, 80.7% of which were adult birds (Pires <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>Other potential threats include habitat loss and degradation through selective cutting of <em>Schinopsis</em> trees, overgrazing by domestic livestock, forest clearance by cutting and burning for conversion to pasture and arable agriculture, and oil exploration activities&#160;(Schunk&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). A decline in the numbers of fledglings recorded across five communal roosts in the Pantanal from 2004-2009 was attributed to the cutting and burning of woody vegetation&#160;(Seixas and MourÃÂ£o 2018). A study of land cover change in the Chaco region estimated that 20.7% of the natural area was transformed between 1976 and 2012, largely through conversion to croplands and pasture (Vallejos <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).","This species is described as 'fairly common' (Stotz <em>et al.</em> 1996). A survey of an area of c.2,700 km<sup>2</sup> in the southern Pantanal in Brazil found six large communal roosts, five of which contained an average June-July total of 4,571 individuals, 3.6% of which consisted of fledglings (Seixas and MourÃÂ£o 2018). Very rough population estimates range from 905,000 - 2,290,000 mature individuals based on the population densities of congeners, the area of the mapped range and assuming only c.10% of the range is occupied. Santini <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2019) estimated a population size of 10,424,783 mature individuals, based on a modelled population density and the area of habitat within the species's extent of occurrence. Scaling up the above estimate of a minimum of 4,406 mature individuals in 2,700 km<sup>2 </sup>to the species's overall range gives a total population size of 9,559,420 mature individuals. The population size is therefore placed in the band 1,000,000 - 10,000,000 mature individuals.","<em>Amazona aestiva</em> has a large range across <strong>Brazil</strong>, <strong>Paraguay</strong>, <strong>Bolivia</strong> and northern <strong>Argentina</strong>. It is found from MaranhÃÂ£o and ParÃÂ¡ in northeast Brazil, west to north and east Bolivia and south to CÃÂ³rdoba, Argentina and&#160;Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (Collar <em>et al. </em>2019, WikiAves 2019). In recent years the species has expanded its range into urban centres such as&#160;SÃÂ£o Paulo and&#160;Campo Grande, possibly as a result of escapes or releases of captive individuals (Schunk&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). Population trends have not been quantified, but the species is heavily trapped for the cagebird trade and is thought to have undergone severe declines in northeast Brazil (A. Saidenberg&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2018).<p></p>",The species is heavily trapped for the cage-bird trade.,"<strong>Research and Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>The species is listed under CITES Appendix II and is listed as nationally Near Threatened in Brazil (MMA 2014). Live capture is illegal in Brazil and in Bolivia (Schunk <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Pires <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), but captive-bred birds may be traded domestically, making trade more difficult to enforce, and incidents of poaching or illegal trafficking often receive little punishment (Ortiz-von Halle 2018). In Argentina, harvesting of individuals has been subject to a quota-based sustainable trade scheme that complied with CITES and invested income into habitat protection (Ortiz-von Halle 2018). However, the scheme ceased following an EU import ban (Ortiz-von Halle 2018). The authorities make considerable efforts to control domestic trade in cities in the Amazon region (Ortiz-von Halle 2018). Individuals confiscated by or handed to the authorities are rehabilitated and many have been released back into the wild (Seixas and Mourao 2000), although there is not always monitoring of the success of such reintroductions (Ortiz-von Halle 2018).&#160;<br/><br/>The Blue-fronted Amazon Project (Projeto Papagaio-Verdadeiro), run by FundaÃÂ§ÃÂ£o NeotrÃÂ³pica do Brasil, is monitoring populations and trade in the species, restoring nesting cavities, developing agreements about conservation with state and federal authorities, encouraging people to report incidents of illegal wildlife trade and carrying out an education programme about the species's conservation in the Pantanal, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil (Blue-fronted Amazon Project n.d., Berkunsky&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017a). It is carrying out research on the species's reproductive biology, survival rates, abundance and habitat use, the impacts of releasing individuals and the potential for bird ecotourism (Blue-fronted Amazon Project n.d.). The Ã¢ÂÂProjeto Papagaio da CaatingaÃ¢ÂÂ (Caatinga Blue-fronted Amazon Project), run by the CEMAFAUNA rescue centre and UNIVASF university, is carrying out rehabilitation and releasing individuals in areas from which the species has been extirpated.

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). Furthermore, the population size is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure).

It is most common in primary lowland forest but is also found from coast to mid-montane areas, including mangroves, nypa forest, freshwater swamp, dryland forest, coastal scrub, denser savanna woodland, parkland, plantations, secondary growth and garden areas. The species becomes much rarer above 1000 m but has been encountered up to 1900 m. Transect evidence from the Solomon Islands suggests that <em>E. polychloros</em>&#160;may be a lowland species within that region&#160;(Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). Typically feeds on fruits - particularly fig-like fruit on the Solomon Islands - seeds, nuts, leaf-buds and blossoms (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). Generally breeds between August and September, possibly January, April to August in the Solomon Islands, but is very likely at any time of the year. Nests in holes high up on tree, generally in a clearing or at forest edge, with up to eight birds attending each nest. Deciduous trees are greatly preferred in Australia (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019).","The two largest threats faced by <em>E. polychloros</em>&#160;are habitat loss, a direct result of increased deforestation, and hunting and trapping for the wildlife trade (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;&#160;Large-scale clearance of lowland forest throughout the Solomon Islands has had a significant impact on the natural habitat of&#160;<em>E. polychlorosi</em>, forcing it into cultivated lands as a result (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). A steep decline in individuals has also been witnessed over the last 30 years throughout northern Australia, attributable in large part to illegal trapping and trade of the species (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). Both habitat loss and trade have resulted in a notable decline in the species population but not to a sufficient degree to classify&#160;<em>E. polychloros</em>&#160;as threatened&#160;(Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019).","Recent surveys and estimates indicate that the population of&#160;<em>Eclectus polychloros</em>&#160;remains large. The species remains common, and in places abundant, throughout the New Guinea mainland, West Papuan Islands, Bismarck Archipelago and many of the Solomon Islands, although it is however, regarded as uncommon on Guadalcanal and the Kai Islands (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2019). The above population estimates were derived from Bell (1982) and Marsden and Symes (2006) population density estimates of 10 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> and 11.3 inds/km<sup>2</sup> in the lowland rainforest and hillforest of mainland New Guinea respectively, and assuming only roughly 10-15% of the mapped range is occupied.","<em>Eclectus polychloros</em>&#160;includes the fours subspecies <em>E. p. aruensis</em>,&#160;<em>E. p. biaki</em>,&#160;<em>E. p. macgillivrayi</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>E. p. solomonensis</em>&#160;and together, they exhibit an extremely large range extending from the west Papuan Islands,&#160;(including Gebe [Rothschild and Hartert 1901] and Gag Island), Kai Islands, Aru Islands and Biak (all <strong>Indonesia</strong>), throughout lowland New Guinea (Indonesia and <strong>Papua New Guinea</strong>), the Admiralty Islands and the Bismarck Archipelago (both Papua New Guinea) and the <strong>Solomon Islands</strong> (except St Matthias, Nissan and Rennell) to the extreme north of Queensland,<strong> Australia</strong> (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2019).","<em>E. polychloros</em>&#160;experiences notable hunting and trapping for the wildlife trade throughout its range (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019).

It can be found from near the coast to mid-montane areas, and may forage in coastal scrub, denser savanna woodland, plantations, secondary growth and garden areas but requires very large deciduous trees with natural cavities in which to nest. The majority of nests are found in <em>Tetrameles nudiflora</em>, large examples of which often contain multiple cavities and are challenging for mammalian predators to climb (Marsden and Jones 1997).&#160;Typically feeds on fruits, seeds, nuts, leaf-buds and blossoms (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019).","Sumba Eclectus has been intensively trapped for local, national trade, and the international cagebird trade which was believed to be driving a very rapid decline in the species (Marsden 1995, Jones&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995).

While the estimated deforestation rate on Sumba has been low (estimated from satellite data to be c. 0.1% annually since 2000: Tracewski <em>et al.</em>[2016]), selective logging of large trees is suspected to be having a significant impact, with suitable nesting holes apparently limiting and seemingly restricted to protected areas.","Sumba Eclectus was estimated to have a population of 1,900 individuals from surveys carried out in 1989 and 1992 (Jones <em>et al</em>. 1995).

Surveys across the whole of the island in the early 1990s found the species to be widespread, but that densities varied considerably and were highest in secondary forest, likely due to abundance of food resources (Marsden 1995). However, the species is likely limited by nest site availability, and selective logging may have reduced the numbers of very large trees even in protected areas.","Previously, Sumba Eclectus was intensively trapped for local, national trade, and the international cagebird trade which was believed to be driving a very rapid decline in the species (Marsden 1995, Jones&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995).

Whilst the estimate of the number of mature individuals displays a large range, it is likely that the population exceeds the threshold required for listing as threatened (&lt;10,000 for Criterion C; &lt;1000 for Criterion D).","<em>Eclectus roratus</em>&#160;includes the two subspecies <em>E. r. voesmaeri</em>&#160;and <em>E. r. roratus</em>&#160;and together, they exhibit an extremely large range spreading throughout the Moluccas, <strong>Indonesia</strong>, having been found on the islands of Morotai, Halmahera, Ternate, Bacan and Obi (including some smaller islands), and Buru, Seram, Ambon, Haruku and Saparua (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019).","<em>E. roratus</em>&#160;is&#160;experiencing notable hunting and trapping for the wildlife trade (Cottee-Jones&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). A recent estimate suggests 810 (+/- 153) individuals are harvested annually for trade on the island of Obi alone and whilst this estimate is thought to be excessively high, the species is now considered uncommon on Obi and was being traded at twice the price of any other parrot species in the bird market (Mittermeier&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Cottee-Jones&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). The populations on other islands, such as Bacan or Halamahera, are however, much less concerning and the species is considerably more common.

The loss and fragmentation of forests is already extensive on Flores, where little semi-evergreen forest below 1,000 m is included within protected areas. These threats are compounded by human population expansion. Even within those areas that receive  protection, illegal logging is continuing as there is virtually no  governmental enforcement of laws. Moist deciduous forest is currently being extensively cleared through land grabbing and establishment of agricultural areas, a factor that is inevitably reducing the range and population of this species. Forest clearance continues in the coastal belt to make way for crops, and illegal logging continues in protected areas.<br/><p></p>","The population is estimated to number 2,500-9,999 mature individuals based on an assessment of known records, descriptions of abundance and range size. This is consistent with recorded population density estimates for congeners or close relatives with a similar body size, and the fact that only a proportion of the estimated Extent of Occurrence is likely to be occupied. This estimate is equivalent to 3,750-14,999 individuals, rounded here to 3,500-15,000 individuals.

In 1988, numbers were extremely low, with only 168 individuals counted during extensive surveys.

Together with <span style=""font-style: italic;"">P. erithacus</span>, it is one of the most popular avian pets in Europe, the United States  and the Middle East due to its longevity and unparalleled ability to  mimic human speech and other sounds. While there has been some domestic demand within range states, most  impacts seem to be due to international trade, probably owing to the  high value of this species<strong></strong>. The Animals Committee of CITES recommended a two-year ban from January 2007 on exports of <em>timneh </em>from  four West African countries (Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and  Guinea),&#160;and since then all of these countries continue to have zero export quotas recommended by CITES. Guinea-Bissau has not issued any export permits since 2000, however these restrictions have been circumvented and exports of wild-sourced birds have continued under the guise of legal trade (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016). For several years Guinea exported significant numbers as Ã¢ÂÂCaptive-bredÃ¢ÂÂ despite there being no commercial-scale breeding facilities in Guinea (CITES 2012). Additionally, multiple shipments have been made from Mali despite the species not naturally occurring there. In late 2015, a shipment of 89 Timneh Parrots that originated in Mali was confiscated in Dakar&#160;(R. Martin&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). In addition, despite there being no legal avenues for commercial exports of wild-sourced birds, some traders continue to advertise exports of recently obtained birds&#160;(R. Martin&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). The import of wild-caught birds into the EU was  prohibited in 2007, leading to a fall in exports of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">P. erithacus </span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">P. timneh</span>, but the number of exportations rose once again in 2008 and 2009 (Anon. 2011), and since then exports have been re-oriented to the Middle East (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016). In 2009, Ghana largely ceased legal exports of <em>P. erithacus</em> in the early 1990s, and around that time trappers and traders from Ghana also moved into other countries. As a result there was additional trapping pressure. Since Ghana ceased commercial exports,&#160;<em>P. timneh&#160;</em>range states (and Mali) have exported 122,868 individuals, with Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea each exporting around 46,000 (not all&#160;<em>P. timneh</em>&#160;as some were&#160;<em>P. erithacus</em>) (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Legal trade as monitored by  CITES may represent only a proportion of the total numbers  captured from the wild. <br/><br/>Habitat loss is undoubtedly having significant impacts throughout the range. Allport (1991) estimated that c.77% of the Upper Guinea EBA forest cover had been lost at the time of that study. Regional forest loss has continued since that date at a high rate (H. Rainey <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2010). In Guinea and Guinea-Bissau, preferred species of nesting trees are also preferred timber species (Clemmons 2002), which is a threat to the stability of breeding populations (Lopes 2015; Lopes <em>et al</em>. 2018b).&#160;An analysis of the factors that predict the distribution and abundance of Timneh Parrots on the BijagÃÂ³s islands of Guinea-Bissau found that the proximity of a permanent human population had a strong negative effect on this species, suggesting human activities are a threat to populations above and beyond the impact they have on forest cover (Lopes <em>et al</em>. 2018a). A recent study predicted that this species could lose approximately 60% of its range by 2050 due to climate change (Freeman <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><p></p>","<p>Based on the estimated density of the species and <em>P. erithacus</em> in Ghana and Guinea, DÃÂ¤ndliker (1992) calculated population estimates for CÃÂ´te d'Ivoire (54,000-130,000 individuals), Liberia (50,000-100,000), Sierra Leone (11,000-18,000), Guinea (5,000-10,000) and Guinea-Bissau (100-1,000). These estimates have been used as the basis for setting export quotas in the past. This gave a total estimate of c.120,000-259,000 individuals in 1992. <br/><br/>However, this is likely to have been an overestimate and the population may now be lower if the species is declining rapidly (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016). Gatter (1997) estimated a significantly higher density of 2 breeding pairs per km<sup>2</sup> in logged forest north of Zwedru, Liberia. More recent estimates place the Liberian population at around 18,000 individuals (Freeman <em>et al</em>. 2018). <br/><br/>A status assessment for the population in Guinea-Bissau indicates a national population of 250-1000 individuals, with very low population densities (or an absence) everywhere in that country, with the exception of small (&lt;8 km<sup>2</sup>) islands remote from permanent human habitation (Lopes 2015; Lopes <em>et al.</em> 2018a<em></em>).&#160;A survey in 2018 in the Gola Rainforest National Park in Sierra Leone recorded the species at an encounter rate of 0.1 groups/h in the National Park and 0.3 in the buffer zone, indicating densities of around 1-3 individuals per km<sup>2 </sup>and a population within the park itself of around 2.400 individuals (Valle <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/><br/>However, the likely total population remains highly uncertain. The population is placed in the band 100,000-499,999 mature individuals in the absence of further data, although it is likely to be closer to the lower bound of this range, or maybe even number fewer individuals than this (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016).</p><p></p>","<em>Psittacus timneh</em>, which was formerly considered conspecific with the Grey Parrot <span style=""font-style: italic;"">P. erithacus</span>, is endemic to the western parts of the moist Upper Guinea forests and bordering savannas of West Africa, from <strong>Guinea-Bissau</strong> east through southern&#160;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Guinea</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sierra Leone</span>, and&#160;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Liberia</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&#160;</span>east to at least 70&#160;km east of the Bandama River in <strong>CÃÂ´te d'Ivoire</strong>.

CÃÂ´te dÃ¢ÂÂIvoire and Liberia are thought to hold the largest populations (DÃÂ¤ndliker 1992). It appears to have disappeared completely from the forests on and near Mt Nimba in Nimba County, Liberia; surveys between 2008-2011 in the East Nimba Nature Reserve and nearby forest failed to find the species, and there was no indication from locals that they have been present in recent times (B. Phalan and F. Dowsett-Lemaire <em>in litt. </em>2012). The species was surprisingly scarce in the Nimba area as early as the 1970s (Colston and Curry-Lindahl 1986). In CÃÂ´te dÃ¢ÂÂIvoire, there have been declines in Tai National Park and the complete disappearance of the species from some areas near human settlements (Martin <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;Gatter (1997) estimated c.1,400 birds smuggled from CÃÂ´te dÃ¢ÂÂIvoire annually between 1981-1984, over 99% being <em>P. timneh</em>. In the Gola Forest area in Sierra Leone it persists but never seems to have been particularly abundant, with groups rarely reaching double figures (J. Lindsell and F. Dowsett-Lemaire <em>in litt. </em>2012).

Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016), and has now been listed on CITES Appendix I (S. Chng <em>in litt. </em>2016). The Animals Committee of CITES imposed a two-year ban from January 2007 on exports of <em>P. timneh </em>from four West African countries (Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea), and the importation of wild-caught birds into the EU was prohibited in 2007 (Anon. 2011). In 2009 Guinea exported 720 <span style=""font-style: italic;"">P. timneh</span>, despite having a quota of 0 (Anon. 2011). Legal trade as monitored by CITES may represent only a small proportion of the total numbers captured from the wild. <br/>The species occurs in a number of protected areas.&#160;In Guinea-Bissau, management of protected areas in participation with local communities has been active for several years. As part of this programme, since 2013, former parrot trappers have been employed as nest guards and in other conservation roles, which has had a positive effect on levels of nest poaching in key nesting sites and nesting trees have been protected during land clearance for shifting agriculture (Henriques and Lopes 2014). Research into breeding biology and diet in Guinea-Bissau is ongoing.

These threats have had such a significant impact that the total population is now very small. <p></p>,"It inhabits humid and wet lowland, foothill and (in south-western Ecuador) dry deciduous forest<strong> </strong>(BenÃÂ­tez <em>et al</em>. 2002; Berg <em>et al</em>. 2007), but occurs in edge habitats and crosses open areas<strong> </strong>(FjeldsÃÂ¥ <em>et al</em>. 1987; Juniper and Parr 1998). It is found mainly below 600 m, but occurs to 1,000 m and occasionally 1,500 m in DariÃÂ©n. In Costa Rica, it strongly prefers <em>Dipteryx panamensis</em> as principal nesting tree, with 87% of all active nests found on this tree (Macaw Recovery Network 2020); local movements may reflect the asynchronous fruiting of <em>Dipteryx panamensis</em> (Powell <em>et al</em>. 1995; Juniper and Parr 1998)<strong></strong>. Breeding pairs typically produce 1-2 chicks per breeding season (Macaw Recovery Network 2019). In south-western Ecuador, it breeds in June-November, and nests in cavities of dead <em>Cavanillesia plantanifolia</em> trees (Berg and Horstman 1996; LÃÂ³pez-LanÃÂºs <em>et al</em>. 1999). Orchids made up 71% of the diet of a pair watched in Ecuador, and their feeding range was estimated at 2,000 ha (LÃÂ³pez-LanÃÂºs <em>et al</em>. 1999). In the non-breeding season, it tends to form flocks that disperse over large distances in search of food (O. Chassot verbally 2004; O. Jahn <em>in litt</em>. 2004, 2005)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","In Central America, original vegetation is converted for agriculture, plantations, cattle-ranching and logging<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Stattersfield <em>et al</em>. 1998; S. Nazeri <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<em> Dipteryx panamensis</em> is selectively logged in Costa Rica (Powell <em>et al</em>. 1995). Pineapple plantations are rapidly expanding and replacing tropical forest habitat in Costa Rica (S. Nazeri <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Annual deforestation rates are high throughout its range (FAO 2001). Deforestation in Panama probably exceeds 30% of its original range<strong> </strong>(G. Angehr <em>in litt</em>. 2005) and in some other countries (e.g., Costa Rica and Ecuador) the historical range was reduced by ~90 % over the past 100 years<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong> (Chassot <em>et al</em>. 2002; O. Jahn <em>in litt</em>. 2004, 2005)<strong></strong>. In its South American range, plans to colonise and develop remoter areas are progressing through infrastructural improvements, particularly the rapid expansion of the road network, which has increased the impact of logging, small-scale agriculture, illegal coca plantations, gold mining, and hunting, which is also affecting some key protected areas (Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund 2001; ÃÂlvarez 2002; BenÃÂ­tez <em>et al</em>. 2002). Large areas of western Ecuador are being purchased, denuded of forest and converted to industrial oil palm plantations (Sharpe 1999). Urbanisation and agriculture have largely extirpated race <em>guayaquilensis</em>, and it is reportedly shot as a crop-pest (Pople <em>et al</em>. 1997; Juniper and Parr 1998)<strong></strong>. There is illegal capture for (mostly internal) trade, food and feathers<strong></strong> (Low 1995; Powell <em>et al</em>. 1995; Sharpe 1999; C. J. Sharpe <em>in litt</em>. 1999; Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000; BenÃÂ­tez <em>et al</em>. 2002).","The species has a disjunct range and localised distribution. The population in Honduras currently numbers c. 400 individuals (H. O. Portillo Reyes <em>per</em> S. Nazeri <em>in litt</em>. 2020), which roughly equates to 260 mature individuals. The population in northern Costa Rica and southern Nicaragua numbered less than 200 individuals, equating to c. 130 mature individuals, in 2019 (Macaw Recovery Network 2019). In Ecuador, the species occurs in two disjunct subpopulations, with a total of up to 50-70 individuals, equating to 35-50 mature individuals, in 2020 (M. Moens <em>per</em> S. Nazeri <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In 2014, the population in Colombia was estimated at up to 1,700 mature individuals (Botero-Delgadillo and PÃÂ¡ez 2011; Renjifo <em>et al</em>. 2014); however this is now considered an overestimate, with the true population size closer to 100 mature individuals (FundaciÃÂ³n ProAves <em>in litt</em>. 2020). For Panama, recent population data is not available (B. Schmitt <em>per</em> S. Nazeri <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Based on these national numbers, the global population is now estimated to number  at least 525 mature individuals; to account for uncertainty and an additional population in southern Panama, the global population is here  placed in the band 500-1,000 mature individuals.","<em>Ara ambiguus</em> occurs as two subspecies. The nominate race occurs from <strong>Honduras</strong> to north-west <strong>Colombia</strong>, and the race <em>guayaquilensis</em> is endemic to western <strong>Ecuador</strong> (FjeldsÃÂ¥ <em>et al</em>. 1987). In <strong>Panama</strong>, it is locally fairly common on the Caribbean slope and in DariÃÂ©n near Cana, Alturas de Nique<strong> </strong><strong></strong>(G. Angehr <em>in litt</em>. 1993, 2005; C. J. Sharpe <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2011) and adjacent Colombia (P. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 1999), and occurs in SerranÃÂ­a de MajÃÂ© and south Cerro Hoya<strong> </strong>(Robbins <em>et al</em>. 1985). In Colombia, it is found in the NariÃÂ±o and ChocÃÂ³ departments, with the stronghold being the DariÃÂ©n lowlands and Uraba forests east of the rÃÂ­o Atrato and SerranÃÂ­a de BaudÃÂ³ (FundacÃÂ­on ProAves <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Honduras, it is restricted to the Moskitia region and is now rare near the rÃÂ­o PlÃÂ¡tano (Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000; Portillo-Reyes 2018). In <strong>Nicaragua</strong>, it persists in the Bosawas Reserve and the Indio-MaÃÂ­z and San Juan Reserve (C. J. Sharpe <em>in litt</em>. 1999; O. Chassot verbally 2004)<strong></strong>. The Sarapiqui region in northern <strong>Costa Rica</strong> is one of the last strongholds for the species (S. Williams <em>per </em>S. Nazeri <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Ecuador, the majority of the population is found in Esmeraldas and the Cordillera de ChongÃÂ³n-Colonche, Guayas (Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000; BenÃÂ­tez 2002). However, within range its distribution is quite local, it being absent from several remote areas<strong> </strong>(G.

The stronghold is in DariÃÂ©n Biosphere Reserve, Panama, and adjacent Los KatÃÂ­os National Park, Colombia. There are important reserves in all range states, but these provide insufficient protection for seasonal wanderers (Juniper and Parr 1998). The Macaw Recovery Network in Costa Rica implements conservation programmes such as species management, habitat protection and restoration, community outreach and behavioural change (S. Nazeri <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Costa Rica, a proposed moratorium on logging <em>D. panamensis</em> has not yet been implemented (Powell <em>et al</em>. 1995; Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong></strong>. A bi-national campaign in the lowlands of the San Juan River (Nicaragua  and Costa Rica) aims to increase awareness of biology, threats and  conservation, and strengthen management of natural resources (Chassot <em>et al</em>. 2006). A government-backed conservation strategy is being implemented in Ecuador<strong> </strong>(E. Horstman <em>in litt</em>. 2005). In 2007, a successful rapid assessment study in search of the last surviving individuals was carried out in the Cordillera ChongÃÂ³n-Colonche, Ecuador<strong></strong><strong></strong> (O. Jahn <em>in litt</em>. 2004, 2005). FundaciÃÂ³n Jocotoco is reintroducing the subspecies <em>guayaquilensis </em>in coastal ChongÃÂ³n-Colonche (M. Moens <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Habitat restoration utilizing native dry tropical forest species that are known or potential macaw food sources is being carried out in the Cerro Blanco Protective Forest, western Ecuador, by the Pro-Forest Foundation, with &gt;250 hectares so far replanted with 35 native species (E. Horstman<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt. </span>2012).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern. <p></p>","It inhabits temperate cloud and elfin forest at 2,400-3,400 m, occasionally observed at 1,400-1,800 m<strong>&#160;</strong>(Juniper and Parr 1998, Botero-Delgadillo and PÃÂ¡ez 2011b) or as high as 3,600 m (Williamson 2020), in areas characterised by trees in the Melastomataceae and Cunoniaceae (Montes and Verhelst 2011). Some populations are nomadic, possibly owing to a heavy dependence on <em>Podocarpus</em> cones. In Ecuador, it nests in dead <em>Ceroxylon </em>wax palms, even where these trees are scarce (Sornoza Molina and LÃÂ³pez-Lanus 1999). In Colombia, this species is also known to nest in the trunks of <em>Weinmannia </em>sp. and utilize <em>Tullandsia </em>sp. for obtaining water (CarantÃÂ³n 2004; Quevedo <em>et al</em>. 2006). Across the Colombian Cordillera Central region, the species was also shown to exhibit preferences towards well-preserved mature forests, although secondary forests were also commonly used (Quevedo <em>et al</em>. 2006, Botero-Delgadillo and PÃÂ¡ez 2011a). The two most important plants for feeding are <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Brunellia</span> <span style=""font-style: italic;"">goudoti </span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Podocarpus oleifolius</span> (Montes and Verhelst 2011). Nesting likely corresponds to food availability, and may not be seasonal in many areas (Sornoza Molina and LÃÂ³pez-Lanus 1999); however, consistent nesting in locations such as Tapichalaca Reserve in southern Ecuador from approximately December through April suggests that this species may nest regularly in some parts of its range (Williamson 2011, Williamson 2016).&#160;<p></p>","Habitat loss and fragmentation was previously considered considerable throughout its range, with 90-93% of montane forest lost in Colombia, but less in Peru (Salaman <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1999, P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1999). However, recent evidence suggest that previous forest loss may have been overestimated (Tracewski&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016, Global Forest Watch 2020). The cutting of wax palms for Palm Sunday services is considered a problem in parts of Ecuador, and palms also suffer poor recruitment because cattle browse young trees, with logging in adjacent areas increasing their susceptibility to parasites and disease<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Salaman <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1999).&#160;In the Loja province of Ecuador, cattle ranching and felling of trees for construction products and fuel has previously led to encroachment of habitats (Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000). Road construction is on-going throughout many areas of elfin and cloud forest in Peru and has caused severe habitat loss in areas such as Abra Malaga<strong> </strong>(H. Lloyd <em>in litt.</em> 2007). In Colombia, it was trapped as a maize pest, whilst hunting was also previously persistent<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>(Salaman <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>1999, Quevedo <em>et al</em>. 2006). Many protected areas are affected by the burning and grazing of pÃÂ¡ramo, settlement, clearance for agriculture, logging, narcotics and gold mining (Wege and Long 1995, Salaman <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1999)<strong></strong>. Burning of pasture is additionally known to inhibit plant succession of the primary habitats occupied by this species (Quevedo <em>et al</em>. 2006). At Tapichalaca Reserve in southern Ecuador, occupation of nest boxes by honeybees (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) and predation by snakes and mammals such as <em>Mustela frenata</em>&#160;may pose dangers to both nestlings and adults (Williamson 2011, 2016). Competition between nesting sites by other resident parrot species and predation by large birds of prey such as the Variable hawk (<em>Geranogetus polyosoma</em>) and Black-chested buzzard-eagle (<em>Geranogetus melanoleucus</em>) may also threaten survival of juveniles (Quevedo <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;<p></p>","Population density estimates of 2.3-6.6 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> have been recorded in the Cordillera de Chilla region of Ecuador (Jacobs and Walker 1999). This is also consistent with recorded population density estimates for congeners or close relatives with a similar body size, and the fact that only a proportion of the estimated Extent of Occurrence is likely to be occupied. Using the best available information therefore, the overall population of the species is estimated to number 11,000-30,000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 7,300-20,000 mature individuals.","<em>Leptosittaca branickii</em> is widely but locally distributed in <strong>Colombia</strong> (both slopes of the central Andes, the southern base of the east Andes and one record from Cerro Munchique, Cauca, in the west Andes), <strong>Ecuador</strong> (isolated massifs in the far north and south, but only in the south on the main Andean ridges) and <strong>Peru</strong> (Cordillera de ColÃÂ¡n and the east Andean slope, with one record on the west slope of the Cordillera Central in La Libertad). It had declined considerably in Colombia and Ecuador, with declines extending to Peru (where it was generally considered to be stable) due to increasing habitat destruction<strong> </strong>(H. Lloyd <em>in litt.</em> 2007). The Nevado del RuÃÂ­z-Nevado del Tolima Massif, Colombia, harbours 1,000-3,000 birds (P. G. W.

Explorations in&#160;PotosÃÂ­ and La Leona in Cajamarca (QuindÃÂ­o) found 134 birds (Botero-Delgadillo and PÃÂ¡ez 2011b).&#160;Overall, the species has seen records on 2,194 Colombian checklists, with a population estimate of 5,000-7,500 individuals that is now likely increasing (FundaciÃÂ³n ProAves&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). It is common within localised sites here (FundaciÃÂ³n ProAves&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). It is also not uncommon on the western slope of the Central Cordillera, with the species recorded in National Parks such as Los Nevados, Purace, and Las Hermosas (CortÃÂ©s&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). The species may also be seen on the eastern slope of the Central Cordillera, but records from the Western range remain skeptical (CortÃÂ©s&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). In forests of the Cordillera de Chilla, Ecuador, densities of c.2.3 birds/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and c.6.6 birds/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;have been estimated (Jacobs and Walker 1999).&#160;<p></p>",,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II.

G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1999, Clements and Shany 2001), as well as Tapichalaca Reserve. Of all these reserves, UcumarÃÂ­ Regional Natural Park, PuracÃÂ© National Park (Colombia), Huashapamba Protection Forest (Ecuador) and RÃÂ­o Abiseo National Park (Peru) are apparently well-protected (Wege and Long 1995). It is also included in the Colombian Threatened Parrot Conservation Action Plan 2010-2020, with the establishment of the Loro Aliazul bird nature reserve helping to protect the habitat of the species (Botero-Delgadillo and PÃÂ¡ez 2011). In Ecuador, a campaign (""CampaÃÂ±a de Loros Palmeros y Palma de Ramos"")&#160;organised by Aves y ConservaciÃÂ³n, Jocotoco Foundation, FundaciÃÂ³n ProAves&#160;and supported by the government aims to reduce unsustainable harvesting of wax palms and promote use of sustainable wax palms as alternatives for Palm Sunday (Williamson 2020). Trapping and hunting are resultantly thought to have stopped (FundaciÃÂ³n ProAves <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;The Loro Parque FundaciÃÂ³n operating in southern Ecuador monitored breeding success in 2008 following successful occupation of 11 out of 17 installed nest boxes (Waugh 2009). The Jocotoco Foundation has additionally installed nest boxes at Tapichalaca Reserve, which are being used (even in preference to natural cavities) by this and other species of parakeet (D.

On Sumbawa <em>T. forsteni</em> ranges from sea level up to 500-700 m, but up to 1,200 m on Sumbawa and 2,150 m on Lombok (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2020); at least on Sumbawa variation in altitudinal range is ascribed to movements made in tracking flowering trees over a large area (White and Bruce 1986). Birds have been reported in breeding condition in May from Sumbawa (White and Bruce 1986). Nests in a deep hole in a large tree (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 2020).","The primary threat is trapping for trade. Birdmarkets in the Balinese and Java regions show that lorikeets remain common (Prihatmoko and Halaouate 2018, M. Halaouate <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Many islands across the Flores Sea (Kalaotoa, Kalao and Tanahjmpea) are also under significant pressure from burning for cashew plantations (J. Eaton <em>in litt</em>. 2020); this is likely to have contributed to the extirpation of the species across this range. Deforestation due to corn planting has also led to the loss of mature trees and flooding across Sumbawa, compounding the affect of trapping on an already rare population (Prihatmoko <em>et al</em>. 2019).","Population density estimates of the congener Coconut Lorikeet (<em>Trichoglossus haematodus</em>) number 1.9-33 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> for Sumbawa (Marsden 1999). Assuming that 10% of the mapped range is occupied by the species, Scarlet-breasted Lorikeet may therefore number 2,100-37,000 individuals, roughly equating to 1,400-25,000 mature individuals. However, the population is thought to number closer to the lower end of the estimate, and considering the known rarity of the species due to increasing pressure from trapping for trade, the population is suspected to be below 1,500 mature individuals. Thus, population size is tentatively placed here in the band of 500-1,500 mature individuals. It is further considered that the largest population on Sumbawa may not exceed 250 mature individuals.","<em>Trichoglossus forsteni</em> (incorporating <em>mitchelli</em>, <em>djampeanus</em> and <em>stresemanni</em>) was previously found on the islands of Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Tanahjampea and Kalaotoa, <strong>Indonesia</strong>. However, recent records show that the species is likely restricted to only parts of Bali (extending into the Banyuwangi region of Java), northern parts of Lombok, and only parts of the West Nusa Tenggara province in Sumbawa (including areas within the vicinity of Mount Tambora; eBird 2020).&#160;On Lombok the species was observed in a flock of 18 above 1,500 m in 2015 (F. Rheindt per Eaton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015), though given the lack of other records for many decades it was assumed that the population is likely to be small. Sumbawa was also previously considered the stronghold of the species, and the species was suggested to be Ã¢ÂÂsecureÃ¢ÂÂ here(Eaton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015), with a large area of potentially suitable habitat remaining on the island. However, it is possible that the population here has&#160;always remained rare (since 1993) owed to extensive trapping (Butchart <em>et al</em>. 1996 <em>per </em>Collar 2017). Thus, it is assumed that only a small, highly unstable population is currently present (Prihatmoko&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019,&#160;M. Halaouate <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>Numbers at Tatar Sepang have for example reduced significantly, with 200 birds recorded in 1997 down to only 50 birds in 2003, few as 6 in 2016 (M. S. Yusuf <em>in litt</em>. 2017 <em>per&#160;</em>Collar 2017), only 4 were observed in 2018 at Batudulang forest in the Sumbawa Besar Regency, and no records in 2019 (Prihatmoko&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). There are additionally no recent records from the Marente Forest (A. Reuleaux <em>in litt</em>. 2017 <em>per </em>Collar 2017). Confiscated birds were previously released on Nusa Penida, although its presence there is uncertain (S. Mahood <em>in litt</em>. 2020, J.

Where this suggests a small population may have existed in Bali following heavy exploitation which extensively reduced numbers between 1910-1920, it cannot be ruled out that existing individuals may be escaped cage birds finding refuge within the area (Prihatmoko <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>As such, it is estimated that only 50 birds have been recorded away from Sumbawa, Lombok and Bali (J.

Some of this apparent increase may be due to improved survey methods but a genuine increase has also taken place.

The species is therefore listed as Endangered.<p></p> <p></p>","The species occurs in arid <em>caatinga </em>with sandstone cliffs (for colonial nesting and roosting) and stands of licurÃÂ­ palms.

The main factor currently limiting the population size is believed to be a reduction of food resources, especially licurÃÂ­ (Brandt and Machado 1990,&#160;Lugarini <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Habitat is cleared for the subsistence cultivation of maize, beans and cassava and for large-scale livestock grazing (Lugarini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). LicurÃÂ­ palm-stands formerly covered 250,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;but have been vastly reduced by livestock-grazing.&#160;Vegetation is cleared through burning, which tends to have little control (Lugarini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). A major fire could now eradicate most of the food supply for the Toca Velha-Serra Branca population. The extraction of firewood and timber also pose threats (IBAMA 2006). In 1992-1995, c.20 birds were caught and sold to smugglers from Toca Velha-Serra Branca (Munn 1995), and in 1996 at least 19 individuals were taken (Reynolds 1997).

Roos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Birds are occasionally persecuted for foraging on maize crops when palm nuts are scarce (Melo Barros <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2006). Hunting for food and wildlife products are potential threats.<p></p>","The most recent population estimate is of 1,694 individuals in 2018 (ICMBio 2018). A study in 2010 found that 20.3% of individuals were reproductively active (Pacifico&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).

In 2013, a nesting site was recorded at&#160;Fazenda Barreiras de Dentro, Canudos (Araujo <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).

It has therefore been uplisted to Endangered.<br/><p></p>","It is resident (perhaps making minor nomadic movements) in primary, logged and secondary forest up to 600 m. It also occurs in mangroves, plantations (including coconut) and agricultural land, suggesting that it tolerates some habitat modification. The highest densities occur in primary forest, and it requires large trees for nesting and communal roosting. Its primary diet consists of arboreal seeds and fruits (Rowley and Boesman 2020). Breeding records are limited.<p></p>","Unsustainable levels of trapping for the cage-bird trade pose the greatest threat. In 1991, an estimated minimum of 6,600 birds (possibly representing a mere quarter of the actual figure) were taken from the wild. Catch quotas for the species were exceeded by up to 18 times in some localities, indicating that trappers were removing in the order of 17% of the population annually. In 2007, the catch quota was 10 pairs, and only for breeding purposes. However, an investigation by ProFauna revealed that  at least 200 White Cockatoo were caught from the wild in North  Halmahera in 2007, far exceeding the quota (ProFauna<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt. </span>2008). Illegal trade continues and is probably grossly underestimated, with many birds being smuggled through Sulawesi and ending up in the bird markets of western Indonesia or being transported to the Philippines (S. Metz <em>in litt. </em>2013). The increased usage in social media and online platforms are additionally providing alternative methods of illegal trade in non-native species in the Philippines (Canlas&#160;<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2017). Nine live birds were for example offered for sale through Philippine social media platforms within just a month of observation (Canlas&#160;<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2017). As both adults and young are taken, exploitation has likely reached unsustainable levels (Rowley and Boesman 2020). Although forest within parts of its range remains relatively intact, exploitation by logging companies has become intensive, and some areas are have been cleared for agriculture and mining.&#160; Vetter (2009) estimated that forest loss within the geographic and elevation range of <em>C. alba</em> was c.20.2% between 1990 and 2003, and projected the loss of c.65.4% of forest in its range over the next three generations. Significant changes in forest cover on Halmahera appear to have driven a concomitant decline in the cockatoo population (F. Lambert <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012).&#160; Habitat and nest-site availability is therefore decreasing, particularly the latter. Furthermore, new logging roads greatly facilitate access for trappers. <br/><p></p>","The global population was formerly estimated to number c.43,000-183,000 individuals (Lambert 1993), however no more recent estimate has been made.","<em>Cacatua alba</em> is endemic to the islands of Halmahera, Bacan, Ternate, Tidore, Kasiruta and Mandiole in North Maluku, <strong>Indonesia</strong>. Records from Obi and Bisa are thought to reflect introductions, and an introduced population breeds locally in Taiwan (China). It remains locally common: in 1991-1992, the population was estimated at 42,545-183,129 birds (Lambert 1993)<strong></strong>, although this may be an underestimate as it was largely based on surveys from Bacan and not Halmahera where the species may have been commoner. Recent observations indicate that rapid declines are on-going, and are predicted to increase in the future (Vetter 2009). CITES data show significant harvest rates for the cage bird trade during the early 1990s, extending at least to the end of that decade (ProFauna, S. Metz <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Annual harvests have declined in actual terms and as a proportion of the remaining population in recent years, but illegal trade continues and is likely to have been underestimated (S.

A project was set up by Burung (BirdLife) Indonesia in 2007 to set up effective protected area management in the Aketajawe-Lolobata National Park, including monitoring wildlife trade, raising public awareness and support, and providing training for Aketajawe-Lolobata National Park staff and related partners (Waugh 2009).&#160; The species is fairly common in captivity (Lambert 1993). More recently, an effort has been made through international NGO's, local zoos, and newly affirmed governments to limit Parrot trafficking across Indonesia. Specifically, the Tasikoki Rescue Centre and World Parrot Trust are hoping to implement multiple targets such as coordinating confiscations, providing care and rehabilitation on Ternate, Halmahera, Bacan, and Obi Islands, as well as providing skills and education in animal husbandry, enrichment, and species identification (Milpacher 2017).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Monitor national and international trade.

Previously thought to be heavily dependent on closed-canopy primary forest, on Sulawesi it is a bird of forest savanna and more open habitats and does not occur in primary forest (Anon. 2012). It nests in tree cavities with specific requirements, tending to use a chink in the trunk or branch, or a pre-existing nest-hole made by another species, often in dead, snagged or rotting trees (Nandika <em>et al.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>. On Masakabing Island, observations suggest that the species's favoured foods include male fruits of <em>Artocarpus communis</em>, fruit and flowers of <em>Cocos nucifera</em> (coconut palm), young leaves and flowers of <em>Ceiba petandra</em>, mangroves, and male flowers of <em>Brassus sudaica</em>, with consumption of the fruit, flowers and seeds of at least six other species observed (Metz <em>et al.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>.

Although exports effectively became illegal in 1994, poor enforcement and monitoring enabled trapping to continue (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2001). Illegal trapping continued in many area including Rawa Aopa Watumohai National Park, Buton and Kadatua islands (Anon. 2012), where populations are now either much-depleted or extirpated entirely (A. Reuleaux <em>in litt</em>. 2021; T. Martin <em>in litt</em>. 2021). Large-scale logging and conversion of forest to agriculture across its range has exacerbated the decline and this is set to continue. The current and future rate of forest cover loss in the current occupied and probably occupied range (based on the estimated mean annual rate over the most recent five years, per Global Forest Watch 2021) is projected to be 16.1% over three generations. Although this species is adaptable to land conversion, it still requires large trees with substantial hollows for breeding, thus is affected detrimentally by the removal of old growth forest. On the Flores Sea islands, agricultural conversion is considered the principal threat, while hunting for food, not the pet trade, was identified as a likely threat (Bashari and Arndt 2016). Juvenile Komodo Dragons <em>Varanus komodensis</em>&#160;pose a threat to nestlings on Komodo (Nandika and Agustina 2012). Competition for cavity nest sites with other parrots and owls in large trees (those targeted by logging activities) leads to low productivity in <em>C. citrinocristata</em>&#160;(Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005) and may affect this species given its similar ecology. On the smaller islands of Roti, Alor and Pantar, capacity for the enforcement of hunting and trading regulations is low (F.

In total, the population is estimated to number 1,800-3,140, or 1,200-2,000 mature individuals, with the best estimate near the higher end of the range. This total is suspected to be only a small percentage of that present three generations ago, when the species was still widespread throughout Sulawesi and large numbers still occurred throughout the Lesser Sundas. The rate of reduction over this time is suspected to have been between 80-90%. Future declines are likely to be at a far slower rate as the majority of the population is now concentrated in protected areas, but trapping continues and there are several islands at imminent risk of losing their remaining few individuals.","This species is endemic to&#160;<strong>Timor-Leste</strong>&#160;and&#160;<strong>Indonesia</strong>, where it was formerly common throughout Nusa Tenggara (from Bali to Timor), on Sulawesi and its satellite islands, and the Masalembu Islands (in the Java Sea). It has undergone a dramatic decline, which is still ongoing, particularly in the last quarter of the 20th century, such that it is now extinct on many islands and close to extinction on most others. Formerly widespread throughout Sulawesi, it is now confined to a small population in South-east Sulawesi province, one island in Central Sulawesi, and three satellite islands to the south (OÃ¢ÂÂConnell <em>et al</em>. 2020; A. Reuleaux <em>in litt</em>. 2021; Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021); there have been no records from Buton since 2009 (Martin <em>et al. </em>2012; T. Martin <em>in litt</em>. 2021). Subspecies <em>djampeana </em>occurs on the Flores Sea islands. Extinct on a number of islands in Nusa Tenggara (Lesser Sundas) on which it formerly occurred, but persists on some, with notable populations on Timor (both West Timor and Timor-Leste), and the Flores and Sumbawa island-groups (including a sizeable population, of c.1,100 individuals, on Komodo). Local information suggests that the species was extirpated from Masalembu Island in 1987, owing largely to the trapping and killing of birds that accompanied the exploration of the archipelago in the late 1980s (Nandika&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009)<strong></strong>. It is likely extirpated from Lombok (F. Verbelen&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.&#160;</span>2012). Only 17-22 of subspecies <em>abbotti</em>&#160;are estimated to persist (A. Reuleaux <em>in litt</em>. 2021) and this population is on the verge of extinction.<br/>A feral population of several hundred birds exists in <strong>Hong Kong, China</strong> and <strong>Singapore </strong>(W. Duckworth&#160;<em>in litt</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2020), outside of the species's natural range.","The species is heavily trapped for the pet trade. In many areas this trapping focuses on chicks, but there is generally no system to regulate harvest in place nor any means to assess sustainability (Andersson <em>et al</em>. 2021). Rates of trapping have declined from historic highs in the late 1980s, when 5,200-12,000 <em>C. sulphurea </em>(that then included <em>C. citrinocristata </em>as a subspecies) were being imported every year into Singapore (Cahill <em>et al</em>. 2006), however the trade of this species is ongoing, with recent extinctions in much of Sulawesi, on Lombok, perhaps Buton (where no sighting since 2009; Martin <em>et al</em>. 2012; T. Martin <em>in litt</em>. 2021).","<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I (2005). A cooperative recovery plan was developed and adopted, and an update was prepared in 2012 (D. Mulyawati <em>in litt. </em>2012). This species (along with <em>C. citrinocristata</em>, which is legislatively current treated as a subspecies of <em>C. sulphurea</em>) has become a national priority in Indonesia for increasing its population by the Ministy of Forestry and Environment (H. Bashari <em>in litt. </em>2016). A recent census of all subspecies to estimate population sizes was recently undertaken (A. Reuleaux <em>in litt</em>. 2021). Conservation efforts have mostly been limited to legal protection, including the creation of protected areas (e.g., National Parks) to control trade and safeguard populations. Populations occur in several protected areas, including on Sulawesi and Timor-Leste (A. Reuleaux <em>in litt</em>. 2021)<strong></strong>. In protected areas on Sulawesi nests have been protected from predators by removing overhanging vegetation and fitting plastic collars around the trunks of nesting trees (Waugh 2013). The most important population in Komodo National Park is currently well-protected and stable thanks to intensive protection (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/>Moratoria on international trade are in place, although it is likely that a large proportion of the trade is domestic. The World Parrot Trust, alongside the Nature Conservation Agency has promoted broader community engagement, including leaving field guides and binoculars to encourage parrot watching and ecotourism, as well as encouraging local involvement in birding trips. Following surveys in 2008 and 2009, the Indonesian Parrot Project and Konservasi Kakatua Indonesia initiated meetings with community leaders and villagers on Masakambing and Masalembu, as well as the local military and police, to raise awareness and garner support for the species's conservation (Metz <em>et al.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>. A conservation-awareness-pride programme has also begun to engage both adults and school children of the Masalembu Archipelago (Metz <em>et al.</em> 2009; Nandika <em>et al.</em> 2009)<strong></strong> and in south-east Sulawesi (Anon. 2012). A 'village regulation' was drafted to make it illegal to trap, own or transport the species, and to initiate measures to reduce habitat destruction and employ a former village head to monitor and protect nests and study the species (Nandika <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2020)<strong></strong>. This locally-mediated zero-trapping policy has allowed the tiny population remaining to increase by nearly threefold in 12 years (Nandika&#160;<em>et al. </em>2020). Similar community-based regulations have been put in place by the Moronone community in Sulawesi, where four village members have been hired as Forest Wardens (Anon. 2012). The wardens protect the species against poachers and carry out monitoring activities (Waugh 2013). The species's pest status may be tackled by the planting of crops to compensate for losses and to act as a 'sacrifice crop', for instance sunflower fields are used to attract the species away from other crops (Waugh 2013). Mangrove restoration is also being used to increase available nesting habitat (Waugh 2013).<br/><strong><br/>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed<br/></strong>Monitor the population trends of each subspecies with regular surveys and identify critical areas for protection. Treat each taxon as a separate unit of conservation concern (Collar and Marsden 2014). Strengthen control, law enforcement and monitoring of trade and establish greater management of captive populations. <span class=""page_assessment_classScheme_content"">In particular, subspecies <em>sulphurea </em>and <em>abbotti</em>&#160;are both estimated to number &lt;100 mature individuals (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. in prep.) and are in urgent need of continued and intensified action. Despite the species's inclusion on CITES I and protection in national law, away from Komodo National Park trapping for the pet trade continues with declines noted in almost all other populations (A. Reuleaux <em>in litt</em>. 2021); improving law enforcement in designated protected areas and other key areas for trade including ports, markets, etc. is therefore critical. Widespread community-based conservation initiatives should be promoted. For instance in Central Sulawesi a population persists on a tiny island with only five families, hence work to protect the species must involve all of these (Nandika and Agustina 2012; Nandika <em>et al. </em>2012). Community engagement programmes for children and adults should begin on other islands where the species is found (Nandika and Agustina 2012). Recommendations made specifically for the protection of the species in Komodo National Park were to conduct annual monitoring, maintain regular patrols, raise awareness in local communities and study human activities and impacts within the park (Imansyah&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005; Benstead 2006)<strong></strong>. Conduct ecological research to clarify options for its management and conservation. Additional targets should be to study the abundance and distribution of nest holes and water sources. Remote sensing data should continue to be used to monitor forest loss in this species's range. Providing artificial water sources near nest locations, i.e. water ponds, is essential for the species on Komodo Island and protecting nests from juvenile Komodo Dragons on Komodo may also be necessary (Nandika and Agustina 2012). Global trade in wild-caught Yellow-crested Cockatoos was banned in 2002; however, the sale of captive-bred birds is still permitted. A recent approach of distinguishing between wild-caught and captive bred birds using stable isotope analysis (Anderssen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021) advocated its use as a forensic tool in monitoring and combatting illegal trade. There are several populations in captivity in Europe: subspecies should be kept separate as isolated conservation units and populations need precautionary management.","(Gmelin, 1788)"

The Cuban Zoological Society is focused on the public campaign 'Mejor volando' ('Better Flying') (M.&#160;CaÃÂ±izares <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The Cayman populations are surveyed annually by the Department of Environment, before and after reproduction to infer number of breeding pairs on both islands. A six-month amnesty registration project is enacted to enable enforcement of the National Conservation Law and to mitigate poaching events. Over 200 birds have been registered (Haakonsson 2020).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed <br/></strong><strong></strong>Discourage the taking of birds from the wild through public education campaigns and enforcement of poaching events. Encourage better bird-keeping practices to increase longevity of captive birds and reduce demand on wild populations. On Abaco, protect vital tracts of broad-leaf forests. On Cuba, make and erect more artificial nests. In the Cayman Islands, expand protected areas systems; reduce illegal poaching and trial artificial nests.

It frequently forages in cultivated lands (AOU 1998)<strong></strong>, such as banana plantations and maize fields (Collar 1997) and is becoming increasingly frequent in urban refuges, such as Santo Domingo (Luna <em>et al</em>. 2018). Breeding is known from February to May, but prospecting pairs have been seen in mid-April, suggesting that the season may extend further into the year (Collar 1997, Juniper and Parr 1998, G. M.

It is also persecuted as a crop-pest, hunted for food and trapped for the local and formerly at least, international cage-bird trade (Juniper and Parr 1998)<strong></strong>. Trapping of adults and robbing nests for chicks to supply the local pet trade is a particular concern because in some areas most families own a parrot, and these only live a few years before they have to be replaced (G. Woolmer <em>in litt. </em>2005, T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012, S. Marsden <em>in litt</em>. 2017)<strong></strong>.

It was common on Hispaniola, but declined significantly during the 20th century. By the 1930s, it was mainly restricted to the interior mountains, where it remains locally fairly common in suitable habitat, particularly within several major forest reserves (Juniper and Parr 1998, Raffaele <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong></strong>. Elsewhere, it is now uncommon, rare or absent. It is however, becoming increasingly frequent in urban refuges, such as Santo Domingo (Luna&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;The introduced population in Puerto Rico numbers several hundred and is apparently increasing (Juniper and Parr 1998)<strong></strong>. <p></p>",,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II.

Conservation action has increased the population since 1975, but it remains Critically Endangered because the number of mature individuals remains tiny. Hurricanes Irma and Maria had significant detrimental impacts on the ongoing population recovery and trends are currently uncertain. If the remaining population and future released birds continue to breed in the wild and numbers remain stable or increase, the species may warrant downlisting in the future.<p></p> <p></p>","Historically, the species occurred in montane and lowland forest and mangroves. It is now restricted to forest at elevations of 200-600 m. It breeds between late February and July, when it nests in large, deep tree-cavities and lays 3-4 eggs (Raffaele <em>et al.</em> 1998; Arendt 2000)<strong></strong>. Since 2001, all known nesting in the wild has occurred in artificial cavities (White <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2006) until in 2013, the first natural nest in 42 years was recorded in RÃÂ­o Abajo (V. Anadon <em>in litt. </em>2013; Coto 2013).<strong></strong><p></p>","Suitable forested habitat for this species has almost entirely been lost. Hunting for food, pest control and the cage-bird trade have had crippling effects in the past (T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). The principal threats are now competition for nest-sites, loss of young to parasitic botflies, predation and natural disasters such as hurricanes (Raffaele <em>et al.</em> 1998; Arendt 2000)<strong></strong>. Red-tailed Hawks <em>Buteo jamaicensis</em> predate parrots and hamper releases of captive-bred individuals. Predator-aversion training prior to release has improved the survival of captive-reared birds after release into the wild (White <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2005)<strong></strong>; nevertheless raptor predation claimed 21% of all released individuals between 2000 and 2002 and is considered to have removed one of the two remaining individuals from the now absent El Yunque National Park population (M. Lopez-Flores&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2019). The species formerly suffered from competition for nesting cavities with Pearly-eyed Thrasher <em>Margarops fuscatus</em>, but this has been significantly reduced by specially designed artificial nesting cavities (T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Predation by alien invasive mammals is also having a serious impact upon productivity, with six fledglings taken by Small Indian Mongooses <em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em> and one nest failure from Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> during 2000-2003 (Engeman <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2006); the Luquillo Forest of El Yunque has the amongst the highest Black Rat densities of any site studied globally (J. Thompson <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Although predation events have not been documented, feral cats <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Felis catus, which </span>are well-documented around the world as devastating bird predators, are also common in parrot habitat in El Yunque National Forest, and represent another threat from an invasive mammal. Parrots regularly disappear without identification of a cause, while cats and mongooses are capable of inflicting unidentifiable losses (R. M. Engeman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). The Puerto Rican Boa comprises an additional potential nest predator (J. Thompson <em>in litt</em>. 2019). It has been suggested that hurricanes are the most serious limiting factor preventing population recovery, and climate change may cause the frequency of hurricane events to increase<strong></strong>. Such devastating hurricane impacts are apparent in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria with the wild population of <em>Amazona vittata</em>&#160;no longer present in El Yunque (M. Lopez-Flores&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2019). Furthermore, rainfall hampers the recovery programme, as chicks that fledge either during or before a major rainfall event have a much higher mortality rate than chicks that fledge during drier periods (Breining 2009)<strong></strong>.<p></p>","As of 2011, the population numbered c.50-70 individuals spread over two areas, roughly equivalent to 33-47 mature individuals. In 2013, this had increased to c.80-100 individuals in the wild (64-84 at RÃÂ­o Abajo and 15-20 at El Yunque). However, f<span lang=""EN-NZ""><span lang=""EN-NZ"">ollowing Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 large areas of habitat were destroyed and the impact on the species's population remains uncertain. The&#160;population at El Yunque has not yet been found in its former range, and 17 out of 22 individuals that had recently been released with transmitters have been found dead (Paravisini-Gebert 2018); there are not currently believed to be any birds in the wild in this region.&#160;The RÃÂ­o Abajo population has fared much better and persisted successfully despite the hurricanes' impacts, comprising 126-139 individuals by the end of 2019 (M. Lopez-Flores <em>in litt</em>. 2019). The e<span lang=""EN-NZ"">ntire RÃÂ­o&#160;Abajo population however is derived from released birds, which are not counted as mature individuals until they have bred successfully in the wild (IUCN 2011). Successful breeding has been recorded, including post-Hurricane Maria (Gilardi 2018), and the size and range of the flock has been witnessed to be increasing however,&#160;due to the late age of first breeding in this species, it is likely that the majority of the population still comprises introduced individuals (Breining 2009; Valentin 2009; T. White&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span>&#160;2012)<strong></strong>. As a result,&#160;<span lang=""EN-NZ"">the total number of mature individuals remains uncertain and is tentatively assumed to remain below 50 due to the large proportion of reintroduced individuals and severe impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Maria.</span></span>","This species&#160;is endemic to <strong>Puerto Rico (to U.S.A.)</strong>, and once occurred throughout the forested parts of the island. An endemic subspecies <span style=""font-style: italic;"">gracilipes</span> occurred on Culebra, but became extinct in 1912. Once abundant, there has been a drastic decline, which reduced the population to c.2,000 by the 1930s and an all-time low of 13 birds in 1975. It has been confined to the Luquillo Mts (El Yunque National Forest) since the 1960s, and the present occupied range of 16 km<sup>2</sup> represents only 0.2% of its former distribution (Snyder<em> et al.</em> 1987)<strong></strong>. Conservation action has prevented the species's extinction, although recovery has been slow and the population remains tiny. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo cut the wild population from 47 to about 23. By the beginning of 1992, there were a minimum of 22-23 parrots in the wild and 58 in captivity, with a record fledging success in July 1992 taking the wild total to 39 or 40 individuals. In 2000, the population numbered 40 wild birds, plus 10 recently re-introduced birds and 100 in captivity, held in two aviaries (Davis 2000; T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>.  In 2001, thieves broke into an aviary and stole a number of captive adults.&#160;In 2004, the wild population numbered 30-35 individuals (Arendt 2000). In 2006, 20 birds were released in the RÃÂ­o Abajo State Forest marking the beginning of a second population in the wild (Velez-Valentin and Boyd 2006)<strong></strong>. A further 26 birds were released here in December 2007 and 19 more in December 2008, with the first two successful nests recorded in the wild at RÃÂ­o Abajo in 2008 (T. White <em>in litt. </em>2005, 2008, 2012)<strong></strong>. As of 2011, the population numbered c.50-70 wild individuals spread over two areas, and about 280 captive individuals (Breining 2009; T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. In 2013, there were 64-84 adults and 16 chicks at RÃÂ­o Abajo and a further 15-20 individuals at El Yunque. In that year, the first natural nest in 42 years was recorded in RÃÂ­o Abajo (V. Anadon <em>in litt. </em>2013; Coto 2013). 400 individuals were recorded in captivity in 2013 (Coto 2013), including a record 107 chicks produced in captivity (Anon. 2013a). In the same year, at least three captive-bred birds were released in the RÃÂ­o Abajo Forest and were subsequently found to be flocking with approximately 150 Orange-winged Amazons <em>Amazona amazonica</em>&#160;away from the original release site (Anon. 2013b). In May 2014, two young birds were discovered in a natural nesting hole outside the boundary of a national park (Anon. 2014b). The impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which hit the island in 2017, on the species are not yet fully known, but the population at El Yunque is no longer known from its natural range and it is considered that there are no longer any wild individuals in the region; 300 individuals persist within the Iguaca aviary however (Paravisini-Gebert 2018; M. Lopez-Flores&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2019). The population at RÃÂ­o Abajo however, persists and alongside the 212 individuals held within the aviary, a population of 126-139 wild individuals are thought to be inhabit the region's forests (Milpacher 2017; M. Lopez-Flores&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2019).<p></p>",,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I. A recovery programme for the species has involved a partnership between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service and the World Wide Fund for Nature in conjunction with the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (White <em>et al</em>. 2012). Major intervention to preserve the species began in 1968, involving provision of highly successful artificial nest sites, control of nest predators and competitors, and captive breeding and reintroduction. The success of newly fledged parrots is monitored using radio telemetry (Meyers 1996)<strong></strong>. <br/>All remaining habitat is protected in the El Yunque National Forest (formerly the Caribbean National Forest) (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000) and the RÃÂ­o Abajo Commonwealth Forest (T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. The population is monitored to help inform management decisions.<br/>Controlling exotic mammalian predators (trapping and toxic baiting) has been shown to be a highly cost-effective way of conserving the species (Engeman <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>2003,&#160;2006; R. M. Engeman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012)<strong></strong>. Trapping data has found the Luquillo Forest to have among the highest Black Rat densities studied in the world, and optimal rat baiting strategies have been devised for application during nesting. Economic analyses based on empirical production costs for captive-bred parrots showed very high benefit-cost ratios for predator management, estimating that the prevention of one parrot loss every 4Ã¢ÂÂ12 years more than offsets all forms of predator management (for all species) in the intervening time (Engeman<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2003).<br/>There are two captive-breeding centres, one at El Yunque, which was first established in 1973 with a new facility constructed in 2007, and one at RÃÂ­o Abajo, constructed in 1989 with the first birds transferred from El Yunque to RÃÂ­o Abajo in 1993 (White <em>et al</em>. 2012). 300 birds are currently held at El Yunque with a further 212 individuals held at the RÃÂ­o Abajo aviary (M. Lopez-Flores <em>in litt</em>. 2019). The captive birds are being managed to preserve as much genetic diversity as possible. A release technique known as ""precision release"" was trialled with six birds in 2008. This involves releasing a small number of captive-reared subadult parrots at each active nest site immediately following the fledging of the chicks, and aims to promote immediate and close interaction between the wild parrots and released birds (T. White <em>in litt. </em>2005, 2008)<strong></strong>. Nearly 100 birds have been released from the RÃÂ­o Abajo aviary in an attempt to establish a second population, which may be aided by lower annual rainfall at the site, lower levels of predation and a change in management techniques (T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Although post-release mortality remains high, successful breeding has been recorded, including post-Hurricane Maria (Gilardi 2018),&#160;and the size and range of the flock is increasing (Breining 2009; Valentin 2009; T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. The newly establishing population at RÃÂ­o Abajo is located around the site of the RÃÂ­o Abajo aviary; it is thought that the presence of the captive birds has encouraged the released birds to establish their population nearby (White <em>et al</em>. 2012). Forty&#160;individuals were released at El Yunque between 2000 and 2004, eight in 2008 and six birds in 2010 (VÃÂ©lez-ValentÃÂ­n 2011); a further 30-35 birds were planned for release in January 2020 (M. Lopez-Flores&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2019). In 2013, plans were made to establish a third population on the island in the Maricao State Forest (western Puerto Rico) (Anon. 2014a).<br/>Following Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017, parrots persist in the RÃÂ­o Abajo forest, but staff are providing supplementary food and providing shaded areas as much of the canopy has been destroyed (Milpacher 2017).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to monitor population trends and establish the overall population trajectory following Hurricanes Irma and Maria (2017). Track the fate of released birds. Maintain the integrated conservation management programme. Improve synchronisation of breeding of wild and captive birds to increase the number of captive-bred chicks that can be fostered by wild parents (Thompson 2004)<strong></strong>. Integrate exotic mammalian predator control (Black Rats, Small Indian Mongooses, feral cats) into the existing conservation management programme, and monitor predator populations to study the efficacy of these measures (R.

Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Its core breeding areas are located in endemic palm forest dominated by coco de mer <em>Lodoicea maldivica</em>. The species nests in tree cavities mainly in dead coco de mer palms, but they have also been recorded to nest in cavities in other palms and living broadleaf trees (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a), with breeding activity from October to March (Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013; Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Deep cavities in hollow <em>L. maldivica</em> trunks with dense canopy cover over the entrance are preferred (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Breeding activity fluctuates widely between years (A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016), with approximately one year in four showing minimal or no breeding activity.&#160;In one study, 53% of nests were found to be successful out of 36 nest attempts with 57% fledgling survival to one year (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a). It is also found in cultivated areas and residential areas with gardens, which are suitable feeding habitats (A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016). It feeds on a range of plant species, the majority of which are endemic and native (Reuleaux <em>et al. </em>2014b). It mainly feeds on the fruit pulp, followed by seeds and buds, with occasional observations of feeding on leaves, flowers, bark and scale insects (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014b).","The decline in this species prior to the 1960s is thought to have been driven mainly by predation by introduced rats and hunting by settlers and farmers (Rocamora and Laboudallon  2013). Other causes of increased mortality have included capture for pets and trade and incidental trapping when other species, namely fruit bats, are targeted. The most serious current threats to the species include ongoing nest predation from rats and cats, poaching of its main nesting tree (coco de mer), and habitat destruction caused by  fires, with potential threats including persecution, netting  of bat species and low genetic diversity (Jackson <em>et al.</em> 2016). Forest fires may represent the most serious threat to the species, with records since the early 1980s showing that approximately every 10 years a large forest fire occurs (Seychelles Islands Foundation <em>in litt</em>. 2014). The availability of nesting cavities may be a limiting factor in very active breeding years, with some females occupying sub-optimal cavities. The poaching of coco de mer nuts could reduce the area of palm forest over the long term, although recent anti-poaching measures appear to be successful.&#160;Rose-ringed Parakeets <em>Alexandrinus krameri, </em>which once posed a major threat, have been entirely eradicated from the Seychelles by the Seychelles Islands Foundation. <em>A. krameri </em>carried diseases such as Beak and Feather Disease Virus, which was a serious threat for <em>C. barklyi </em>(Fogell <em>et al.</em> 2018). The impacts of introduced species through nest predation and competition for nest-sites may not yet be serious enough to limit the population; however, mynahs are increasing on Praslin (Dueker 2018). Invasive yellow crazy ants are an emerging threat, with numbers having increased substantially in Praslin's palm forest habitat from 2015-2018. The ants have caused at least two <em>C. barklyi</em> nest failures. Yellow crazy ants are now being controlled with a baiting programme across the VallÃÂ©e de Mai and other parts of Praslin's remaining palm forest (N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2020). Predation of fledglings by cats and dogs is probably limited and post-fledging mortality is not currently a major concern as most fledglings are seen again in the year after they fledge (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data). Another risk factor for the species is the substantial and so-far unexplained fluctuations in its breeding activity, with minimal or no breeding occurring approximately every four breeding seasons (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data).","Point count surveys conducted on Praslin in 2010 and 2011 found a  density of 0.14-0.24 individuals/ha, resulting in a total population  estimate of 520-900 individuals (95% confidence intervals) obtained  through distance sampling methodology (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013).  After reviewing recent survey results, Rocamora and Laboudallon  (2013) estimate a total breeding population of fewer than 200 pairs,  suggesting that there could be fewer than 400 mature individuals. The most recent point count survey in 2018 estimated a population of 1392 (1096-1742, 95% CI) individuals. On the basis of this new data, it is assumed that there are 730-1170 mature individuals in the population.","<em>Coracopsis barklyi</em> is resident on Praslin, with occasional non-breeding records on Curieuse (c.1 km north of Praslin), <strong>Seychelles </strong>(Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013). Point count surveys conducted on Praslin in 2010 and 2011 found a  density of 0.14-0.24 individuals/ha, resulting in a total population  estimate of 520-900 individuals (95% CI) obtained  through distance sampling methodology (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013).  No individuals were detected on Curieuse during point counts over four  days and during supplementary fieldwork, thus it is assumed that there  is no resident population there (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013). Prior to the surveys by Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. (2013), the most recent  population estimate on Praslin was of 645 individuals (95% confidence  intervals: 404-1,034 individuals), using distance sampling at 39 random  points (Walford 2008). However, this study was deemed to have several  methodological and analytical constraints, which meant that assumptions  of the distance sampling method were not met (Walford 2008; Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013) and resulting in an estimate range that was considered too broad to serve as a basis for conservation planning (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013). After reviewing recent survey results, Rocamora and Laboudallon  (2013) estimate a total breeding population of fewer than 200 pairs,  suggesting that there could be fewer than 400 mature individuals. A review of previous survey results indicates that this species&#160;has recovered from a low point of c.30-50 individuals in one area of the island in the late 1960s,  increasing until the at least the turn of the century, with uncertainty  over the trend since then (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013; Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013). Surveys in 2018 produced a population estimate of 1382 (1096-1742, 95% CI) individuals on Praslin (Dueker 2018), however this cannot be directly compared to the 2011 population estimate due to differences in survey seasons, which affects the vocalisations (the main detection method) of this parrot.",,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species has been protected by law since 1966 (Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013). Endemic palms have been protected since 1991, and the restoration of native palm forest on Praslin and Curieuse is on-going. The species occurs in Praslin National Park, which was established in 1979, and the VallÃÂ©e de Mai was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Fond Ferdinand and Curieuse island are managed as nature reserves, but they lack official protected status. Fond Peper, an area of mature palm forest of approximately 60 ha, adjacent to the VallÃÂ©e de Mai, and another area of high quality black parrot breeding habitat, is now also under the management of Seychelles Islands Foundation and being prioritised for conservation. Artificial nest boxes were provided between 1983 and c.2005 (Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013; A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016), although these are now no longer in use, with no apparent ill effects to the population (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data).<br/>There is a firebreak around the core breeding area at VallÃÂ©e de Mai,   but it is not guaranteed to work in the event of a large fire which   cannot be quickly contained (Seychelles Islands Foundation <em>in litt</em>.  2014). The firebreak proved to be only partially effective when a fire destroyed several hectares of high quality breeding habitat in the south of Praslin in 2010 (A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016). The poaching of coco de mer nuts is being counteracted with  increased security and a regeneration programme, and awareness-raising  activities have been conducted to reduce persecution by farmers. Rose-ringed Parakeets <em>Alexandrinus krameri </em>were eradicated from MahÃÂ©&#160;in 2019 (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data). An experimental trial to assess the effects of rat control on <em>C. barklyi</em> breeding success was carried out in 2017-2018 and 2018-2019. And intensive baiting programme to control yellow crazy ants began in 2019 (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data). <br/>A national action plan for the species was produced in 2009 and includes plans to introduce the species to Silhouette, along with captive breeding on FrÃÂ©gate Island and North Island if appropriate habitat restoration and management can be carried out (reviewed by Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013). Other conservation actions identified for this species include the control of introduced species, population monitoring and public awareness campaigns (reviewed by Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013). Analysis using statistical models is planned in 2014 after annual counts have been conducted for three years without interruption, and  conclusions regarding the species trend since 1982 will be published  (G. Rocamora <em>in litt</em>. 2014). Repetition of the distance sampling survey is being done at 5-10 year intervals (A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue distance sampling of the <em>C. barklyi</em> population at regular intervals and at a fixed time of year to monitor the population trend, and narrow the confidence intervals of the population estimate. Continue control of yellow crazy ants across the core <em>C. barklyi</em> breeding area, and research into the impacts of rats on nest success. Conduct research into the potential causes of the seasonal fluctuations in breeding activity. Protect additional areas of native palm forest. Restore suitable native habitats. Continue awareness-raising activities to eliminate any residual persecution. Update the national species action plan and develop a plan to translocate <em>C. barklyi</em> to Silhouette.",Newton 1867

However, semi-deciduous forest along more humid valleys at from sea level 1,000 m is optimal breeding habitat (Renton and Salinas-Melgoza 1999, Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al</em>. 2009)<strong></strong>, and provides key food resources during the dry season (Renton 2001)<strong></strong>. A low tolerance to human disturbance is evident as the species is encountered more frequently in conserved than in degraded woodland (Renton and IÃÂ±igo-Elias 2003), and prefers conserved semi-deciduous woodland (Monterrubio-Rico&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). Seasonality plays an important role in the species's life history, influencing diet, habitat use, daily activity, and movements with the species undertaking altitudinal and latitudinal migrations (Renton 2001, Renton and Salinas-Melgoza&#160;2002, Salinas-Melgoza and Renton 2005,&#160;SÃÂ¡nchez-Barradas <em>et al</em>. 2017). The species shows a low rate of reproduction (Renton and Salinas-Melgoza 2004). In MichoacÃÂ¡n, nest sites were located preponderantly in relatively inaccessible rugged mountainous terrain, where the large stands of tropical semideciduous forests remain on steep slopes with an average gradient of 22ÃÂ° (Ortega-RodrÃÂ­guez and Monterrubio-Rico 2008).&#160;<br/><p></p>","Capture for domestic and international trade is the major threat to wild populations. The species is highly valued in trade (CantÃÂº&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007) and was the most captured Amazon parrot species in the early 1980Ã¢ÂÂs (IÃÂ±igo-Elias and Ramos 1991). From 1998-2008, 860 <em>Amazona finschi</em>&#160;were legally captured (J. C. CantÃÂº <em>in litt</em>. 2017). Illegal trade is intensive and widespread, and&#160;<em>Amazona finschi</em>&#160;is one of the most frequently confiscated Mexican parrots (K. Renton&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>.&#160;It was the sixth most confiscated parrot in Mexico from 1995-2005 and the third most confiscated Mexican parrot in the USA from 1992-2005 (CantÃÂº <em>et al</em>. 2007). During 1981-2001, 4,061 individuals were recorded as traded internationally, of which 79% were exported directly from Mexico and 64% were taken from the wild (CITES 2004a)<strong></strong>.&#160;Captive breeding of parrots was promoted by Mexican environmental authorities to help in conservation but only 154<em> A. finschiÃ¢ÂÂs</em> were bred from 2002-2008 and it didnÃ¢ÂÂt help stop illegal trade (CantÃÂº in press 2020). It remains one of the top five most-captured Mexican parrot species, with an estimated 5,000 individuals/year captured illegally in Mexico (CantÃÂº&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007). It is one of the most illegally sold parrot species on the internet (J. C. CantÃÂº, per. obs.). Adults and juveniles are easily netted in large numbers because of their habit of congregating at communal roost sites late in the afternoon (Renton 2005, K. Renton&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>. Chicks are commonly poached from nests (K. Renton&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>. During interviews with local people throughout the species's range, 75% reported poaching in their area (K. Renton&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>. In addition, this species is reported to require semi-deciduous forest with tall, mature trees for nesting, and may not adapt to nesting in modified areas (see Monterrubio-Rico&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009, Marin-Togo&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Habitat loss and degradation, mostly for conversion to both small-holder and large-scale cultivation and pasture are serious threats (K. Renton<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2007, A. Salinas<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2007, Ortega-RodrÃÂ­guez and Monterrubio-Rico 2008). Semi-deciduous forest along the Pacific coast is being lost at a greater rate than any other forest type in Mexico (Masera&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996, K. Renton&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>, resulting in the destruction of nest sites and reduction in the extent of this crucial breeding habitat (Renton 2005)<strong></strong>. In MichoacÃÂ¡n, the more easily accessible potential nesting areas, such as plains or rolling hills, have now been converted to extensive cattle ranching or agriculture (Ortega-RodrÃÂ­guez and Monterrubio-Rico 2008). Large development projects, such as dams, have also resulted in loss of breeding habitat for the species (K. Renton<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Semi-deciduous forest now covers only 3,847 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;or 6.6% of the species's current known distribution (Marin-Togo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Despite the various pressures on habitats, Marin-Togo <em>et al</em>. (2012) determined that <em>Amazona finshi</em>&#160;has disappeared from more than 70% of its estimated former range and that primary habitat comprises more than half the area of absence for this species (60.7%), which reinforces the view that trapping pressure is the predominant threat to the species. Nevertheless,&#160;the endemic <em>Amazona finschi</em> faces new threats associated with global change through increased habitat loss and climate change. The increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes making landfall along the Pacific coast has indirect cascading effects on parrot reproduction through the loss of nest-sites and reduction in food resources (Renton <em>et al</em>. 2018). While reproductive output of <em>Amazona finschi</em> recovered following landfall by a minor hurricane (Renton <em>et al</em>. 2018), landfall by the major Hurricane Patricia in 2015 resulted in the loss of 61.5% of nest-sites, and reduced reproductive output by nesting parrots, among the lowest recorded for the species, which has yet to recover 4 years after hurricane landfall (K. Renton unpubl. data).<p></p>","Renton and IÃÂ±igo-Elias (2003) estimate the global population at 7,000-10,000 individuals, based on surveys covering the majority of the species's global range. This roughly equates to 4,700-6,700 mature individuals. An estimate that 5,000 individuals each year were captured illegally in Mexico (CantÃÂº&#160;<em>et  al</em>. 2007), implies that the population estimate by Renton and IÃÂ±igo-Elias (2003) could be an underestimate, but this is retained in this assessment until better data are available.","<em>Amazona finschi</em> is endemic to the Pacific coast of <strong>Mexico</strong><sup> </sup>(Forshaw 1989, Collar 1997, Juniper and Parr 1998). Historically, its range extended from southern Sonora and south-western Chihuahua to Oaxaca (Forshaw 1989, Howell and Webb 1995)<strong></strong>.  The species has been practically extirpated from Oaxaca, as well as parts of Nayarit, Jalisco, Durango, Colima and MichoacÃÂ¡n, and has undergone significant population declines in many areas of its original range, especially in the lowlands (Renton and Elias 2003)<strong></strong>. Despite local declines the species is most abundant in the states of Jalisco, MichoacÃÂ¡n and Sinaloa (Renton and IÃÂ±igo-Elias 2003)<strong></strong>. A recent survey, carried out in appropriate habitat in 53 out of 77 50x50 km squares covering the species's entire range, estimated its population size to be 7,000-10,000 individuals (Renton and IÃÂ±igo-Elias 2003)<strong></strong>.  The species has disappeared from 37% of the localities where it was historically recorded (Renton and IÃÂ±igo-Elias 2003, K. Renton <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, and has shown a decline of 29% in its original distribution over the last 20 years (CITES 2004b)<strong></strong>. It is suspected to be in very rapid decline based on its disappearance from over 70% of its estimated former range (Marin-Togo <em>et al</em>. 2012).<em> <p></p></em>",,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>In 1999, the Mexican government established a Plan for the Conservation, Protection and Recuperation of Psittacines in Mexico, within which&#160;<em>A. finschi</em>&#160;is considered a priority species (Macias Caballero&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong></strong>. In 2004, the species was upgraded to CITES Appendix 1, and in 2007, a proposal was approved for the species to be upgraded in 2008 from 'Threatened' to 'Endangered' under Mexican wildlife law (K. Renton<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2007). In Mexico, considerable efforts have been made to tackle illegal national trade, with at least 52 seizures during 1997-2003 (CITES 2004b). Inspections in Mexico resulted in the seizure of 266 live individuals of the species being offered illegally in the pet trade from 1995 to 2003 (CITES 2004b), and in 2008, the Mexican government introduced a ban on the trade of all native parrot species in the country (CantÃÂº and SÃÂ¡nchez, 2011a, K. Renton&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). A decline in seizures of <em>A. finschi</em> occurred after the 2008 ban (J. C. CantÃÂº <em>in litt</em>. 2013).The species is found in three Biosphere Reserves; Sierra de Alamos-Arroyo Cuchujaqui, southern Sonora, and Chamela-Cuixmala and Sierra de ManantlÃÂ¡n, Jalisco, and is reported to occur in seven Important Bird Areas; however, some of these lack official protection or conservation programmes (CITES 2004a), and only 1.5% of its distribution is found in protected areas (Marin-Togo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012).&#160;A national awareness and educational campaign Ã¢ÂÂNo Compres Pericos SilvestresÃ¢ÂÂ was initiated by Defenders of Wildlife and Teyeliz in 2009 aimed at raising awareness of the impact of illegal trade on the conservation status of parrots in Mexico (http://www.pericosmexico.org/index.html) (CantÃÂº and SÃÂ¡nchez 2011 a). Birdwatching is being promoted in areas inhabited by the species and quick bird identification guides with <em>Amazona finschi</em>&#160;on the cover have been created (J. C. CantÃÂº pers. obs.)<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Monitor population trends through regular surveys. Monitor levels of habitat destruction and degradation. Implement trade regulation strategies in the 1999 plan. Conduct outreach work and environmental education as outlined in the 1999 plan. Carry out habitat conservation and the recovery of wild populations as recommended in the 1999 Plan. Monitor the success of strategies from the 1999 plan. Protect the remaining tropical forest stands on slopes greater than 6ÃÂ°: ideally all areas on steep slopes should be restored to forest, in order to provide habitat for all native wildlife (including Lilac-crowned Parrot) avoid soil erosion and promote alternative economic activities on the rugged coastal areas such as recreation and tourism (Ortega-RodrÃÂ­guez and Monterrubio-Rico 2008). Promote birdwatching as an alternative source of income for landholders and rural communities to insure species and habitat conservation (CantÃÂº <em>et al</em>. 2011b). Regional landscape planning proposals need to incorporate conservation corridors that connect areas of conserved semi-deciduous forest both latitudinally along the coast, and altitudinally to the highlands inland, so as to facilitate wildlife movements, and provide alternate refugia for the species following hurricane impacts or seasonal droughts (K. Renton <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<p></p>","(Sclater, 1864)"

The population is now so small that lower, but significant, rates of decline are likely in the future. <p></p>","It inhabits dense thorn-forest, savanna, tall deciduous forest and humid riverine woodland, occasionally up to 500 m (with a report of up to 1,377 m at Totula, Veracruz, Mexico [Monterrubio-Rico 2013]). Birds favour semi-arid regions in the northern Atlantic lowlands, but more humid savannas further south. In Belize, it inhabits pine savannas and adjacent evergreen forest patches, and ""<em>guatemalensis</em>"" occurs in coastal scrub, palm savanna and mangroves (Lousada and Howell 1996, Eisermann 2003). Food privation and fire cause occasional wanderings. Breeding typically occurs in February-June, although it occurs earlier in the&#160;MichoacÃÂ¡n region between January-May, in the snags of&#160;<em>Roystonea</em>&#160;palms or in nests in tree cavities (Eisermann 2003). The species exhibits a narrow niche breadth for nest-trees, utilising just 11 species with 81% of nests found in&#160;<em>Astronium graveolens</em>, <em>Brosimum alicastrum</em>, and <em>Enterolobium cyclocarpum</em>; nests are typically built&#160;1439 m ÃÂ± 995 from human settlement with 62% at distances &gt;1 km (Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al</em>. 2014; TÃÂ©llez-GarcÃÂ­a 2008). Nesting success is only 0.5 fledglings per nest (E. C. Enkerlin-Hoeflich <em>in litt</em>. 1994). The species consumes seeds from the forest's semi-deciduous species, such as&#160;<em>Astronium graveolens</em>, <em>Crataeva tapia</em>, and <em>Sideroxylon capiri</em>, as well as fruit from&#160;<em>Ficus insÃÂ­pida</em>&#160;and other tropical dry deciduous forest species (Renton 2002, Monterrubio-Rico&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).<p></p>","Habitat loss has been extensive, with 77.4% of primary habitat within the species's potential historical distribution and 80% of the Tamaulipas lowlands cleared for agriculture and pasture, and increasing settlement along the Western Highway in Belize (Somerville 1997, Monterrubio <em>et al. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. Forest loss throughout the species's full range remains extreme, totaling ~22.5% across three generations (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Belize, where much of the suitable habitat lies outside the national protected area system, the regions occupied by the species remain under heavy pressure from development and illegal fires (B. Miller <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Palm savannahs at the only known breeding site in Guatemala are used for non-intensive cattle-grazing (Eisermann 2003), which continues to be a threat here (Fundary <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). <br/><br/>Many thousands of individuals of this species are illegally exported from Mexico and some from Belize each year, and it is popular in domestic markets (Low 1995,&#160;Miller and Miller 1997, Somerville 1997). Illegal domestic traffic is intense in Mexico and may account for 38% of the species's recent distributional loss (T. Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al. in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. In the Mexican states of Michoacan, Guerrero and Oaxaca, it is mainly nestlings that are taken for the pet trade (T. Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al. in litt. </em>2007), with 76% of 13 active nests monitored in 2012 being poached (T. Monterrubio-Rico <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Guatemala, it is reported that local military authorities are complicit in the illegal trade of this species, and nest poachers are reported to frequent the species's nesting site (Eisermann 2003, K. Eisermann <em>in litt</em>. 2007). In addition, hunting for food by local fishermen has been reported from Guatemala (Eisermann 2003, K. Eisermann <em>in litt</em>. 2007). In Belize, it is hunted and persecuted for damaging crops (S. N. G. Howell <em>in litt</em>. 1998)<strong></strong> and is still a victim of the illicit pet trade, capture for which involves the cutting down of nesting trees (B. Miller <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Its range around coastal MichoacÃÂ¡n is estimated to have declined by 1,507 km<sup>2</sup>, of which 576 km<sup>2</sup> can not be attributed to habitat loss and thus may be due to poaching for trade (Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al.</em> 2007). <br/><br/>Additional threats to isolated populations of the species may occur from the increased impact of high intensity hurricanes. In October 2018, the category 3 Hurricane Willa passed directly over the Islas Marias on the Pacific coast of Nayarit, which maintains the island endemic subspecies of <em>Amazona oratrix tresmariae</em>. It is unknown how this endemic population may have been affected by the hurricane impact.<p></p>","The population was estimated at 7,000 individuals in 1994. This is roughly equivalent to 4,700 mature individuals.","<em>Amazona oratrix</em> has undergone a dramatic population decline, judged at 90% since the mid-1970s, to 7,000 birds in 1994.

Howell&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 1998) and under considerable threat (Low 1995), with an old report and a 1993 record from PetÃÂ©n, <strong>Guatemala</strong> (Clay 1999). Race&#160;<em>hondurensis</em>&#160;(including proposed race ""<em>guatemalensis</em>"")<em>&#160;</em>occurs from Punta Manabique in Guatemala to extreme north-west <strong>Honduras</strong> (Lousada and Howell 1996).&#160;<br/><br/>Extensive surveys, and the use of MaxEnt algorithm, have calculated that the area with suitable ecological conditions, primary habitat, and the confirmed presence of the species may include 65,737 km<sup>2</sup>, fragmented into five areas.&#160;Its Mexican coastal Pacific range may now cover 18,957 km<sup>2<strong>&#160;</strong></sup>&#160;fragmented into three potential metapopulations, with the broader distribution in the Gulf Coast estimated at 46,780km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Monterrubio-Rico&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Monterrubio-Rico&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). On the coast of MichoacÃÂ¡n, Mexico, it has been calculated that the species occupies 45.6% of its estimated historic distribution (Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al.</em> 2007), yet only 39% (3,432 km<sup>2</sup>) of this occupied range was modelled to constitute suitable habitat conditions for the species, and just 6.6% (587 km<sup>2</sup>) comprised its preferred tropical semi-deciduous forest habitat (Monterrubio-Rico&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, 2016).&#160;<em>Amazona oratrix</em>&#160;abundance was evidenced to be 6 times greater in areas of preserved forest rather than in the fragmented, human-disturbed, and intensively cattle ranched areas of the region (Monterrubio-Rico&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Based on intensive field surveys during 2001-2007, it was verified that the species's range has contracted in Colima state, and it has been extirpated in 11 municipalities in coastal Guerrero state (from Tecpan de Galeana to Marquelia) (T.

Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al. in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. The population at Punta de Manabique declined by 30% to 70 individuals from 1994 to 2001 primarily because of nest poaching (Eisermann 2003<em>, </em>K.

Habitat preferences during the breeding season vary between years (Ortiz-Maciel <em>et al</em>. 2010)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It nests colonially in solution holes in limestone cliffs. Breeding follows the fruiting pattern of pines, with pairs arriving between April and May<strong><sup></sup></strong>, laying in early July, and fledging in October-November (Macias Caballero 1998, ValdÃÂ©s-PeÃÂ±a and Ortiz Maciel 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

It has therefore been classified as Near Threatened.","It is widespread in wooded hills, mountain slopes, scrub, cultivation and gardens in humid or semi-arid areas from sea-level to mid-elevation forest (Haynes-Sutton <em>et al. </em>2009). The species feeds on the buds and fruit of many trees and on crop species, and has been regarded as a pest (del Hoyo<em> et al.</em> 1997, Haynes-Sutton<em> et al.</em> 2009). It breeds in March (Juniper and Parr 1998). The species is commonest at middle elevations (below 1,000 m) and absent from the very wet John Crow Mountains and also from montane forest, although occasionally it occurs in wooded cultivation in the Blue Mountains (Lack 1976, C. Levy and S. Koenig <em>in litt</em>. 2014). The species has been reported to nest only in arboreal termite nests, which must be supported by medium-to-large trees (C. Levy and S. Koenig <em>in litt</em>. 2014).","Despite legal protection, small-scale poaching for the local pet trade and hunting of parakeets for both food and as crop pests continues. Enforcement is weak and many members of the public remain uninformed that killing a bird with a catapult (slingshot) is defined as ""hunting"" (i.e., ""hunting"" is typically viewed as killing gamebirds with a shotgun), and, consequently, illegal. Environmental education campaigns focus on the two larger, more charismatic endemic <em>Amazona </em>parrots (C. Levy and S. Koenig<em> in litt.</em> 2014). <br/>Habitat loss and fragmentation are perhaps the greatest on-going threats, particularly the conversion of coastal habitats for hotel, residential and commercial development, although deforestation rates are not high (estimated at ~2.75% across three generations [Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016]). Foraging behaviour is poorly-known, and use of the landscape in search of seasonally-available food resources is not understood (C. Levy and S. Koenig<em> in litt.</em> 2014).<br/>As a frugivore, the species is susceptible to starvation following extreme weather events, such as hurricanes. Compounding the short-term loss of food from the forest canopy, hungry parakeets have been observed feeding on fruits blown to the ground during a hurricane; this behaviour may render them more vulnerable to predation by invasive alien predators, such as mongoose (<em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>) and cats (<em>Felis catus</em>), or to persecution by humans. Additionally, temporary loss of natural food resources may make them more prone to attack any crops which escaped the ravages of strong winds and rain; this also will lead to persecution by farmers. <br/>The number of suitable termite nests may be a limiting factor of parakeet reproductive performance (C. Levy and S. Koenig<em> in litt.</em> 2014), while the importation and escape into the wild of alien psittacines is a further potential threat. Invasive alien psittacines pose threats via the introduction of harmful pathogens (e.g. Psittacine Circovirus / Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease) and parasites, competition for food resources, and, depending upon the species, may compete for nesting substrates (C. Levy and S. Koenig<em> in litt.</em> 2014). At least one alien species of parakeet (<em>Psittacula krameri</em>) has become established in Jamaica, occurring in Kingston/St. Andrew, where it is expanding in number (C. Levy and S. Koenig<em> in litt.</em> 2014).","A preliminary population estimate is that the population could approach as few as 10,000 mature individuals, placed here in the band 10,000-19,999 mature individuals.","<em>Eupsittula nana</em> is endemic to the island of <strong>Jamaica</strong>, where it is commonest in mid-elevation wet limestone forest and does not occur in the wet John Crow range in the east.",,"<strong>Conservation and research actions underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II. Protected by national law.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation and research actions proposed</strong><br/>Carry out basic studies of natural history, demographics, movements, etc. Identify and protect critical habitats.

The  newly-defined <em>P. robustus</em> is monotypic, while <em>P. </em><em>fuscicollis </em>is polytypic, including the races <em>fuscicollis</em> and<em> suahelicus.</em>","This newly-split species has a small population, which is currently estimated to be stable. It is therefore listed as Vulnerable.","It  occupies montane mist-belt evergreen <em>Podocarpus</em> forest in the temperate zone from 1,000-1,400 m (Downs 2015; Collar and Boesman 2017). Although primarily resident, the species undertakes three different types of excursion into lower areas: daily flights,  short visits with overnight stops, and more extensive periodic  wanderings, all largely prompted by the availability of <em>Podocarpus</em> fruits (Collar and Boesman 2017).","Human impacts on indigenous forests, most of which have little visible protection, may affect nest site and food availability. There is a long history of logging by settlers, with selective logging taking place more recently and continued illegal logging in some areas (Downs 2015). Removal of adults from the wild for illegal trade is a potential threat; the number of birds involved is uncertain but it does not currently appear to be having a population-level impact. There is a potential risk that recognition as a species, and CITES listing, could increase international demand for trade in the species in the future (Collar and Fishpool, 2017). An increasing prevalence of Psittacine Beak-and-Feather disease has been predicted, but the likely impact is uncertain (Downs 2015). Climate change may lead to increased drought within the range and have negative impact on recruitment and fruiting of indigenous forests.","The population<em> </em>has been assessed annually by the Cape  Parrot Big Birding Day since 1997. Population numbers prior to 2002 were below 500, but since then the  numbers have been higher (average 1,366 ÃÂ± 245 individuals between 2008  and 2012, with a high count of 1,786 individuals in 2009; Downs <em>et al. </em>2014), likely a consequence of an increase in survey coverage.<br/><br/>In Downs (2015) the  population size was listed as 1,100-1,500 mature individuals. However, since it was stated that it was unknown what proportion of these individuals  were adults, this estimate is considered here to relate to total individuals rather than mature individuals. Treating the population estimate of Downs  (2015) as an estimate of the total number of individuals would also fit  with the estimates presented by Downs <em>et al. </em>(2014) and Downs  and Singh (2016). This estimate could be altered to take into account  the maximum record of 2009, so that the range is 1,100-1,786  individuals, which would roughly equate to 733-1,190 mature individuals, rounded here to 730-1,200 mature individuals. There are estimated to be 60-80 individuals in the isolated Limpopo subpopulation, 500-600 in the Amatole forests, and 400-500 each in the former Transkei and southern KwaZulu-Natal forests (Downs 2015). The number of individuals in the largest population is therefore thought to be 800-1000, roughly equivalent to 530-667 mature individuals.","This species is restricted to eastern <strong>South Africa</strong>, where it occurs in <span class=""sp-ssp"">KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces, with a small, isolated northern subpopulation of 60-80 individuals in Limpopo.","Removal of adults from the wild for illegal trade is a potential threat; the number of birds involved is uncertain but it does not currently appear to be having a population-level impact. There is a potential risk that recognition as a species, and CITES listing, could increase international demand for trade in the species in the future (Collar and Fishpool 2017).","<strong>Conservation and research actions underway<br/></strong>Long-term monitoring by the annual Cape Parrot Birding Big Day encourages public involvement and awareness of the species. Ongoing research includes conservation of forest habitat, monitoring of food availability, nest box provision, monitoring of bird trade, monitoring of disease, captive breeding, genetics and planting of food trees. There are a number of ongoing educational outreach activities. The Cape Parrot Working Group liaises with researches, aviculturalists, conservation authorities and the public. The Cape Parrot Project has been ongoing since 2009 in the Amatole region; its activities include growing indigenous trees, provision of nest boxes, and community outreach work. It also rescues and rehabilitates birds with beak-and-feather disease (Downs 2015). 179 nest boxes were provided for the parrots in Hogsback, Eastern Cape, between 2011-2012 (Wimberger <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).<br/><strong></strong><br/><strong>Conservation and research actions needed<br/></strong>Continue annual population monitoring. Consider controlled captive breeding to meet demand for the pet trade. Elevate the conservation status of unprotected and partly-protected forests within the range.

Its future ought to be secured by the large number of national parks in which it occurs, but many of these currently provide ineffective protection and much of the species's range, at least in Mexico, falls outside the protected area network.<p></p> <p></p>","In South America it inhabits humid lowland forest and adjacent cleared areas, wooded foothills and canyons. In Mexico, it is found in arid and semi-arid woodland, and pine-oak, humid lowland and riparian forest, moving seasonally to dense thorn-forest <strong> </strong>(Juniper and Parr 1998,<strong> </strong>Renton 2004)<strong></strong>, although in Puno, Peru it was found to be more abundant in a mosaic of shade coffee plantations and degraded remnant forest patches than in neighbouring pristine Yungas forest<strong> </strong>(S. K. Herzog <em>in litt</em>. 2007). In Mexico it has also been reported to use agricultural fields and orchards (E. R. RodrÃÂ­guez-RuÃÂ­z and A. Banda <em>in litt</em>. 2016). It occurs from sea-level to 3,600 m (E. R. RodrÃÂ­guez-RuÃÂ­z and A. Banda in litt. 2016), but the core range is 500-1,500 m<strong> </strong>(Juniper and Parr 1998)<strong></strong>. Nests and large communal roosts are sited on cliff-faces or in large trees<strong> </strong>(Howell and Webb 1995a<strong>, </strong>Juniper and Parr 1998, Cruz-Nieto <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;In Jalisco and Nayarit on the Pacific coast of Mexico, the species nests in tree cavities located high above the ground in tall emergent trees of <em>Enterolobium cyclocarpum</em>&#160;(de la Parra-MartÃÂ­nez <em>et al</em>. 2015). Surveys of cavity availability found a low density of cavities with characteristics suitable for nesting by Military Macaws, and these were concentrated in semi-deciduous forest (de la Parra-MartÃÂ­nez <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Mexico the breeding season begins in January when pairs form, with nesting taking place in May, June and July (E. R. RodrÃÂ­guez-RuÃÂ­z and A. Banda <em>in litt</em>. 2016).<br/><strong></strong><br/><p></p>","Habitat loss and especially domestic trade are the chief threats, even within reserves (Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000). In 1991-1995, 96 wild-caught specimens were found in international trade, with Bolivia and Mexico possibly the most significant exporters<strong> </strong>(Chebez 1994,<strong> </strong>D. Brightsmith <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. In Mexico, it is still one of the most sought-after species in the illegal cagebird trade; in 1995-2005, it was the fifth most seized Mexican Psittacine species by the country's Environmental Enforcement Agency, becoming the fourth most seized Psittacine species in 2007-2010 (J. C. CantÃÂº <em>in litt</em>. 2010). In many areas it nests in relatively inaccessible cavities on cliff walls, which provides some protection against the pressures of nest poaching (E. R. RodrÃÂ­guez-RuÃÂ­z and A. Banda&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). However, nest poaching is a severe threat in Jalisco and Nayarit where the species nests in tree cavities (C. Bonilla <em>in litt. </em>2007, K. Renton <em>in litt. </em>2007).&#160;Furthermore, the dependence on nest-cavities in tall emergent trees means there is limited availability of suitable nest sites for Military Macaws (de la Parra-MartÃÂ­nez <em>et al</em>. 2015), and these are vulnerable to forestry practices that extract large valuable-wood trees (K. Renton <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Jalisco, Mexico, macaws were not found in deforested areas, even where abundant <em>Hura polyandra</em> (an important food source) were left as shade for cattle<strong> </strong>(Renton 2004). GARP analysis estimates that the species has suffered 23% habitat loss within its range in Mexico<strong> </strong>(RÃÂ­os MuÃÂ±oz 2002) and currently, forest loss throughout the species's full range is estimated at ~13% per three generations (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;As the species feeds on agricultural land (crops include corn, walnuts and olives) it may also be threatened by persecution (E. R. RodrÃÂ­guez-RuÃÂ­z and A. Banda&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). Gold mining operations in Mexico, particularly in the Balsas Region, also pose a threat owing to the associated deforestation and pollution (A. Siguenza and L. Vasquez Reyes&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). In Jaumave, Tamaulipas, Mexican gray squirrels (<em>Sciurus aureogaster</em>) may compete for food with the species&#160;(E R. RodrÃÂ­guez-RuÃÂ­z and A. Banda&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;One sub-population in the Cauca valley, Colombia, numbering fewer than 50 mature individuals, may shortly be lost as a dam is expected to flood the sole nesting cliff (FundaciÃÂ³n ProAves 2011).&#160;<p></p>","The population size was preliminarily estimated to fall into the band 10,000-19,999 individuals, equating to 6,667-13,333 mature individuals. However more recent estimates suggest the population is now smaller than previously thought. With one estimate of 1,000-2,000 breeding pairs across the species's range (C. Bonilla <em>in litt</em>. 2016) and another of a total of 5,000-10,000 individuals (G. Marateo, P. Grilli, M. Juarez and I. Berkunsky <em>in litt</em>. 2016). The population estimate is therefore estimated at 3,000-10,000 individuals, equating to 2,000-6,666 mature individuals.","This species&#160;occupies a massive but fragmented range from <strong>Mexico</strong> to <strong>Argentina</strong>. In Mexico, it occurs from central Sonora to Guerrero (JimÃÂ©nez-Arcos <em>et al</em>. 2012) on the Pacific slope, east Nuevo LeÃÂ³n and Tamaulipas to San Luis PotosÃÂ­ on the Atlantic slope<strong> </strong>(Howell and Webb 1995a), and Durango, Nayarit, Morelos, Puebla, Oaxaca and Queretaro in the interior (C.

A new population was recently reported from two localities in the Catatumbo-BarÃÂ­ National Park on the Colombian-Venezuelan border<strong> </strong>(J. E. AvendaÃÂ±o <em>in litt</em>. 2011). It is very local in north <strong>Venezuela</strong> (Rojas-SuÃÂ¡rez <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004), and occurs disjunctly in the east Andes of <strong>Ecuador</strong>, <strong>Peru</strong> (also in the rÃÂ­o Chinchipe drainage [A.

It has been extirpated from many areas, especially in Mexico (practically extirpated from most of Veracruz and Hidalgo on the Atlantic side, and Chiapas, Oaxaca, as well as coastal regions of Guerrero and Michoacan on the Pacific slope<strong> </strong>(Howell and Webb 1995, K.

Vasquez Reyes <em>in litt</em>. 2016). In Tamaulipas the population is estimated at between 200 and 350 individuals with the main threat to these populations being trapping at feeding sites (E. R. RodrÃÂ­guez-RuÃÂ­z and A.

Similarly, an assessment of 21 known localities in the southern Yungas of Bolivia found a total of 37 individuals at eight of these (L. Rivera <em>in litt. </em>2012). Populations in Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia face continuing threats, and further extirpations are expected. Much of the species's habitat in Mexico has been subject to deforestation with patches of remaining suitable forest isolated by highly disturbed areas (Dirzo <em>et al</em>. 2011,&#160;A.

There are an increasing number of records from agricultural land, mainly in citrus crops, passion fruit and mango plantations (Zamore and Durand 1998)<strong></strong>. Breeding takes place between February and June, with nests usually situated in the cavities of large forest trees, such as <em>Dacryodes excelsa</em>, <em>Amanoa caribea</em> and <em>Sloanea </em>sp.

Hurricane-related damage has also been important: hurricane Maria has at least temporarily reversed recent population increases. Hunting and illegal trade are now low-level threats, but illegal wildlife trade across the Caribbean is a constant concern and there is increasing pressure from illegal wildlife trade centered in Europe (P.

As a consequence of comprehensive conservation measures commencing in 1980 and accelerating since 1990, the species increased slowly from fewer than 50 (post-hurricane David in 1979) to over 300 mature individuals. After hurricane Maria hit Dominica in September 2017, the population plummeted again, so that is is now extremely small. Preliminary post-Maria surveys suggest the species may have fared better during Maria than during David, largely due to effective <em>in situ</em> conservation efforts prior to the hurricane. However, the frequency of intense hurricanes is projected to increase, with potentially severe consequences for the species. Imperial Amazon is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered. <br/><br/><p></p>","The species mainly inhabits montane and elfin forest at 600-1,300 m, but forages down to 150 m in response to food shortages (Dominica Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment <em>in litt.</em> 2000, Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000, Wiley <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>. It is highly sensitive to habitat modification, readily abandoning traditional foraging and nesting territories (Dominica Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. Nests are situated in cavities in tall forest trees (the same species used by Red-necked Amazon <em>Amazona arausiaca</em>), with breeding between February and June (coinciding with the dry season). The nest cavity is heavily festooned with vines and epiphytes, making observation of nesting activity difficult (Dominica Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment <em>in litt.</em> 2000, Wiley <em>et al</em>. 2004, Reillo and Durand 2008)<strong></strong>. <br/><p></p>","The species is threatened by habitat loss, forest degradation and by direct exploitation. Currently, the most severe among these threats is hurricane damage, which not only leads to vast destruction of habitat, but also to direct mortality. Hurricane Maria destroyed about 30% of the forest cover on Dominica and defoliated a large proportion of the remaining trees (Forestry and Agriculture Department <em>per</em> Palmer <em>et al.</em> 2018). In the aftermath of Maria, most individuals were observed foraging in lowland areas outside of their range (S. Durand <em>per </em>C. Palmer <em>in litt.</em> 2019), indicating that, at the time of the sightings, montane forests had not sufficiently recovered from the impacts of the hurricane and by now only offer a low quality habitat (C. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Hurricanes frequently occur in the Caribbean and therefore&#160;are a  natural feature of the species's habitat, which may cause the species to  undergo cyclical fluctuations (C. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2019; Reillo 2019).  However, as the frequency of particularly intense hurricanes in the  Caribbean is projected to increase as a consequence of climate change  (Bender <em>et al</em>. 2010; Knutson <em>et al.</em> 2010), there is an increased likelihood that severe storms may hit Dominica before the population has a chance to recover (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2019; C. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2019).<br/>&#160; <br/>Apart from hurricane-related damage, forested habitat is also lost for conversion to agriculture (Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000). Deforestation may increase competition for nest-sites with the more numerous Red-necked Amazon <em>Amazona arausiaca</em>, as the two species  come increasingly into contact (Dominica Ministry of Agriculture and the  Environment <em>in litt.</em> 2000; Wiley <em>et al</em>. 2004)<strong></strong>.<br/>&#160; <br/>Imperial Amazon is further threatened by trapping. Opportunistic hunting for food and occasional trapping for the cage-bird trade contributed to the species's decline up until the 1990s (P. R. Reillo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Local trade has been considerably reduced, if not eliminated, as a result of a successful education programme, but foreign bird-collectors still pose a threat (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000, Reillo 2019)<strong></strong>. Two captive individuals housed at a facility run by Dominica's Forestry, Wildlife and Parks Division, one of which was rescued after Hurricane Maria, were exported to a private breeding facility in Germany without coordination with the Forestry, Wildlife and Parks Division or parrot programme managers (Cox and Oltermann 2018; Palmer <em>et al.</em> 2018; Reillo 2019). While issues relating to the ex-situ conservation of this species are  complex and often controversial (Reillo <em>et al</em>. 2011; Reillo 2019), the overall number of individuals held in captivity is extremely low (Reillo <em>et al</em>. 2011; C. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2019; Reillo 2019). The species's life-history characteristics and ecology render <em>ex situ</em> captive breeding an unjustified, ineffective recovery tool, whereas comprehensive <em>in situ</em> conservation efforts have proven successful (Wiley <em>et al</em>. 2004; Reillo and Durand 2008; Reillo <em>et al</em>. 2011; Reillo 2019). The potential extirpation of the species in the wild may result in the functional extinction of  the species (C. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2019). However, Dominica's Forestry, Wildlife and Parks Division has successfully maintained the Parrot Conservation and Research Center (PCRC), a rehabilitation facility for releasable parrots with a long-term holding capacity for non-releasable birds.<p></p>","Prior to 2017, when hurricane Maria hit Dominica, the population was estimated to number 250-350 individuals in total, roughly equivalent to 160-240 mature individuals (P. R. Reillo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Since Maria, the population has not been quantified due to the inaccessibility of the core parts of the range in the interior of the island (C. Palmer<em> in litt</em>. 2019; Reillo 2019). However, inferences can be drawn based on the effects of previous hurricanes and on recent sightings of the  species. Maria is considered to be the strongest and possibly most  destructive hurricane to strike the island in Dominica's recorded history. Previously, the most  severe storm was hurricane David in 1979, after which the population of  Imperial Amazon plummeted to 40-60 individuals (Evans 1991). Tentatively assuming that the impact of Maria on the  population was at least as severe as David, the population size again may have  decreased significantly. Preliminary field data are encouraging with direct sightings of 11 individuals about half a year  after hurricane Maria (Palmer <em>et al.</em> 2018) and over 20 since June 2019, distributed broadly across the pre-hurricane range (A. Fairbairn <em>per </em>C. Palmer<em> in litt</em>. 2019; P. R. Reillo and S. Durand <em>in litt</em>. 2019). To account for the uncertainty surrounding the current population size, and until more recent estimates become available the species is here conservatively assumed to number around 50 mature individuals, and placed in the band 40-60 mature individuals.","<em>Amazona imperialis</em> is endemic to <strong>Dominica</strong>, where it inhabits the Morne Diablotin area (primarily on the north-east, south, south-west and south-east slopes [Raffaele <em>et al.</em> 1998, Wiley <em>et al</em>. 2004, Reillo and Durand 2008]<strong></strong>) and the Northern and Central Forest Reserves; it has recently re-established a small population in the Morne Trois Pitons National Park near Morne John (Reillo 2001, Wiley <em>et al. </em>2004, P. R. Reillo <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. The species is known to have declined significantly in the past, when the population plummeted to an estimated 25-40 mature individuals after Hurricane David in 1979 severely damaged the forests on the island. Conservation action then increased the population to 160-240 mature individuals in 2012 (P. R. Reillo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. Until recently, the species's strongholds used to be in Morne Diablotin National Park and its surroundings, the Central Forest Reserve and the Morne Trois Pitons National Park and surroundings. In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017, the population likely declined drastically; importantly, some of the remaining individuals have been observed foraging both within and outside of the species's typical montane forest habitat (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;It is likely that the species moved into lower-quality lowland habitat to forage for food as a consequence of the hurricane's impact on primary forest (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2018). By January 2018, preliminary surveys detected 11 Imperial Amazons at nine localities throughout the island, all outside of typical forest habitat (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2018). By June 2019, further sightings were reported within and adjacent to the Morne  Diablotin and Morne Trois Pitons National Parks, Central Forest Reserve,  Northern Forest Reserve and on other sites on privately-owned land (A. Fairbairn <em>per </em>C. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2019, P. R. Reillo <em>in litt</em>. 2019).  Most sightings occurred along forest edges and on ridges (P. R. Reillo <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Two individuals, one of which was rescued after the hurricane and brought to a rehabilitation centre run by Dominica's Forestry, Wildlife and Parks Division, were exported to a private breeding facility in Germany without coordination with the Forestry, Wildlife and Parks Division or parrot programme managers (Cox and Oltermann 2018, Palmer <em>et al.</em> 2018, Reillo 2019).<p></p>",This species is threatened by trapping for the cage-bird trade and by hunting for local consumption.,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong></strong><strong><br/></strong>CITES Appendices I and II. The species is protected by domestic legislation, and it is recognized as the National Bird of Dominica. In recent years, there have been considerable efforts to protect suitable habitat and sensitise local citizens to its needs. Successful conservation education programmes have markedly reduced local trade. It is protected across all national parks, the Northern Forest Reserve and the Central Forest Reserve, but important areas adjacent to these reserves remain unprotected (Dominica Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment <em>in litt.</em> 2000; Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000; Wiley <em>et al</em>. 2004)<strong></strong>.  An area of 33 km<sup>2</sup> of the Northern Forest Reserve has been designated as the Morne Diablotin National Park (Collar 1997; Wiley <em>et al. </em>2004)<strong></strong>. It is also present in small numbers in the Morne Trois Pitons National Park (Reillo 2001; Wiley <em>et al. </em>2004; Reillo and Durand 2008)<strong></strong>. The Forestry, Wildlife and Parks Division has  successfully maintained  the Parrot Conservation and Research Center  (PCRC), a rehabilitation  facility for releasable parrots with a  long-term holding capacity for  non-releasable birds. All birds held at  the PCRC survived hurricane  Maria, and the center successfully  rehabilitated many individuals  impacted by the hurricane (Reillo 2019; P. R. Reillo and S. Durand<em> in litt</em>.   2019). The only captive breeding of the species occurred at the PCRC  in  2010 (Reillo <em>et al</em>. 2011). Post-Maria conservation efforts include   rebuilding the PCRC and increasing the Forestry, Wildlife and Parks   Division's capacity to recover parrots entirely on the island (P. R.  Reillo and S.

The remaining population is thought to be very small and fragmented into small subpopulations, which are undergoing continuing declines. The species has therefore been classified as Endangered.","The species inhabits forests and forest/agriculture mosaic habitats in elevations between 400 and 2,200 m (Botero-Delgadillo and PÃÂ¡ez 2011, Botero-Delgadillo <em>et al.</em> 2013). It is most frequently observed in flocks of 3-9 individuals, occasionally in larger flocks of 20-30 individuals (Botero-Delgadillo <em>et al</em>. 2013). As in other Pyrrhura species, it can form 'super-flocks' of up to 70 individuals when spatially-clumped food resources are available (Botero-Delgadillo and PÃÂ¡ez 2011). It is suggested that dispersal in the species may be constrained by fragmentation, with observations that flocks fly over and inside forest and at less than ten meters above canopy-level indicating unwillingness to cross open habitat (Botero-Delgadillo and PÃÂ¡ez 2011, Botero-Delgadillo <em>et al. </em>2013). The species is not thought to be more restricted to primary forest than other <em>Pyrrhura </em>species given the frequency that it has been encountered in forest-agriculture mosaics (Botero-Delgadillo <em>et al.</em> 2013).","Habitat loss is the greatest threat to the species, with an estimated 70% of the species original habitat having been lost to cattle ranching and other clearance (Botero-Delgadillo <em>et al</em>. 2012a). The majority of the speciesÃ¢ÂÂs distribution is highly fragmented and the landscape is dominated by a complex matrix of agricultural land, cattle pastures, secondary growth and small patches of forest (Botero-Delgadillo et al. 2012a,b). The Venezuelan side of the Sierra de PerijÃÂ¡ is being rapidly colonised, particularly by Colombian farmers  (Sharpe 2015; C. J. Sharpe<em> in litt</em>. 2015). There are concerns that this may disrupt movement and dispersal, due to the species being unwilling to cross large-extensions of open habitats (Botero-Delgadillo <em>et al.</em> 2013). Habitat destruction in the PerijÃÂ¡ Mountains has also been driven by the illicit drug trade and associated enforcement operations, and conservation activities for this species are considered likely to be significantly constrained throughout much of the range (FjeldsÃÂ¥ <em>et al. </em>2005). The species has also been recorded in the wild bird trade, and local people within the species's range are said to value the species as a pet (Tovar-MartÃÂ­nez 2010; Botero-Delgadillo and PÃÂ¡ez 2011; Botero-Delgadillo<em> et al.</em> 2012a).","Despite comprehensive searches within the presumed range the species is only known from a limited number of sites. In Colombia, the local population in OcaÃÂ±a was estimated at 46-98 individuals and the population in El Carmen at c. 150 individuals (Botero-Delgadillo and PÃÂ¡ez 2011). The national population in Venezuela is estimated at fewer than 1,000 mature individuals (Sharpe 2015). The species is rare and patchily distributed within its range (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020; eBird 2021); based on available data a preliminary population estimate is of 1,000-2,499 mature individuals overall. <br/>The subpopulation structure has not been formally investigated. Nevertheless, due to the species's localised distribution, its reluctance to cross open areas and the increasing fragmentation of suitable habitat (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020; eBird 2021; Global Forest Watch 2021) it is assumed that it forms several small subpopulations, the largest of which does not exceed 250 mature individuals.","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Pyrrhura caeruleiceps</span> is found on the west slope at the northern end of the east Andes from south Cesar state north through Los Motilones into the Sierra de PerijÃÂ¡, on the border of <strong>Venezuela</strong> and <strong>Colombia</strong>. It is estimated to have lost approximately 70% of its  original habitat within its Colombian distribution, and its area of  occupancy within Colombia is predicted to be less than 3,700 km<sup>2</sup>  (Botero-Delgadillo<em> et al.</em> 2012a,b). Being an extremely poorly-known species in Venezuela, there are a few specimens and sight records from just four localities in Zulia state (Botero-Delgadillo <em>et al</em>. 2012b); it is very  infrequently recorded in recent years despite significant fieldwork (Sharpe 2015, C. J. Sharpe<em> in litt</em>. 2015).",The species is valued as a pet; wild individuals are captured for trade (Botero-Delgadillo and PÃÂ¡ez 2011; Botero-Delgadillo<em> et al.</em> 2012a; Tovar-MartÃÂ­nez 2010).,"<strong>Conservation and research actions underway</strong><br/>In Colombia, parts of the species's distribution is protected within the national protected areas system or in private reserves (E.

Muccio <em>in litt</em>. 2021). In El Salvador, the species also suffers heavy nest-poaching (R. Bjork <em>in litt</em>. 2011). At least 100 individuals are legally kept as pets in the country, while 57 individuals were confiscated from illegal trade between 2014 and 2019 (N. Herrera <em>in litt</em>. 2021). It has been reported that each year c.5,000 young <em>A. auropalliata</em> are smuggled out of the La Mosquitia region, Honduras (<em>per</em> O. Andino <em>in litt</em>. 2011), although this has not been verified. Such numbers would not be unrealistic given that on average, 8,388 birds were recorded in export from Honduras each year in the period 1987-1989 (Wiedenfeld 1993). Not only adults and chicks, but also eggs are sought after by traffickers (L. Joyner<em> in litt</em>. 2021). An increase in seizure levels in Mexico suggests that trapping pressure is currently increasing (J. C. CantÃÂº <em>in litt</em>. 2021). The numbers recorded in export from Nicaragua appeared to be decreasing in the past (Lezama <em>et al</em>. 2004); however, nest poaching is still high (J. A. DÃÂ­az Luque <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011; M. Lezama <em>in litt</em>. 2011), and thought to affect over 50% of nests in Rivas department (M. Lezama <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Recent market surveys however show that trade has been increasing again since 2016 in Managua, Rivas and further cities, despite being prohibited by law (M. Lezama <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Costa Rica roughly a third of nests were raided, accounting for c.85% of the all nest failures observed (Wright <em>et al</em>. 2001; Grijalva 2008), although in another study conducted near Liberia, up to 100% of the nests located by researchers had been poached (A. Salinas-Melgoza <em>in litt</em>. 2011). In southern Guatemala, almost only those nests which are inaccessible by poachers successfully fledge young (L. Joyner <em>in litt</em>. 2021). The nest failure rate was generally found to be very high in  Costa Rica (89%), with the majority of nest failures found to result  from poaching for the pet trade (64%) (Dahlin <em>et al</em>. 2018). Poaching of nestlings can also affect future breeding in the species, as damage of nest trees when extracting nestlings can make the tree no longer usable as a nest site (C. Dahlin<em>&#160;per </em>A. Salinas-Melgoza <em>in litt. </em>2016). It is thought that twice as many are taken from the wild than are recorded in export, based on a mortality rate of 54% during capture and transit (PÃÂ©rez and ZÃÂºÃÂ±iga 1998 in Grijalva 2008), although a survival rate of one in three or four has also been reported (<em>per</em> O. Andino <em>in litt</em>. 2011).<br/>Anthropogenic threats are thought to exacerbate the effects of poor rates of recruitment to the breeding population (Grijalva 2008). In parts of the range, the species suffers from cavity occupation by Africanised Bees (R.  Bjork <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Climate change may also have an impact on the species as there have been hotter and longer dry seasons in the region, though the impact of this on the species is essentially currently unknown (C. Dahlin and T. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2016).","Partners in Flight (2019) estimate the population to number fewer than 50,000 mature individuals; however, recent evidence suggests that the population is considerably smaller than this. The species is known to be in rapid, ongoing decline. Current population estimates include 400-520 individuals in Guatemala (Muccio 2019; M. Dupin <em>in litt</em>. 2020; L. Joyner <em>in litt</em>. 2021), up to 200 individuals in El Salvador (N. Herrera <em>in litt</em>. 2021) and a few hundred individuals in Honduras and Nicaragua, respectively (L. Joyner <em>in litt</em>. 2021). Census data for Costa Rica suggest a population of at least 1,195 individuals in 2021 (C. SÃÂ¡nchez <em>in litt</em>. 2021).<br/>Comprehensive surveys carried out in 2016 and 2018-2019 following a  standard protocol estimate a population of 2,361 individuals across the  range (Wright <em>et al</em>. 2019; Dupin <em>et al</em>. 2020). This roughly equates to 1,575 mature individuals. To account for uncertainty, the population is here placed in the band 1,000-2,499 mature individuals.&#160;It is assumed that the species forms three subpopulations, equivalent to the three recognised subspecies <em>auropalliata</em>, ranging from Mexico to Costa Rica, <em>caribaea</em>, on the islands north of Honduras, and <em>parvipes</em>, in northeastern Honduras and northern Nicaragua (see del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 2020).","<em>Amazona auropalliata</em> is found in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Mexico</span> and Central America, occurring along the Pacific slope of the isthmus in southern Mexico (Oaxaca and Chiapas), <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Guatemala</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">El Salvador</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Nicaragua</span> and north-western <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Costa Rica</span>, the Bay Islands of <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Honduras </span>(see also Gilardi 2014), and the Caribbean slope in eastern Honduras and north-eastern Nicaragua (Juniper and Parr 1998; Taylor 2013). Costa Rica is considered the species's stronghold (Wright <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/>Despite occurring mainly in forests and woodlands, in recent years the species appears to have established populations in cities and urban parks, likely originating from escaped cagebirds (C. Muccio <em>in litt</em>. 2019; N. Herrera <em>in litt</em>. 2021; C. SÃÂ¡nchez <em>in litt</em>. 2021).",The species is considered one of the most sought-after psittacines in the Central American pet trade; it is trapped at extremely high levels throughout its range (Wiedenfeld 1993; R. Bjork <em>in litt</em>. 2011; J. Gilardi <em>in litt</em>. 2011; C. Muccio <em>in litt</em>. 2021).,"<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Conservation Actions Underway</span><br/>CITES Appendix I.

The species has been the subject of a number of local studies, some on-going, aimed at gathering information on population trends and threats. The extent of wildlife exploitation for trade has been highlighted by local media, for example in Honduras (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">per</span> O.

Initiative 007-99 in Nicaragua aimed to ban any international and domestic trade for the species in 2004 (Ministerio del Ambiente y Recursos Naturales 2004), and&#160;an initiative by the Mexican government has banned capture and trade of all native Mexican species (J. Cantu&#160;<em>per</em>&#160;A. Salinas-Melgoza&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). An awareness campaign by a number of NGOs has been launched in Mexico aiming to protect all parrot native species, including the Yellow-naped Amazon (J. Cantu <em>per</em>&#160;A. Salinas-Melgoza <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). Nestbox schemes and educational campaigns have been established in Nicaragua (Anon. 2016). On Ometepe Island in Nicaragua and on Guanaja Island in Honduras, poaching could be stopped due to intensive conservation action, and the populations there now show start to recover (L.

In particular, habitat loss caused a lack of nest site availability, as dead wax palms were cut for use as durable fence posts and live palms were logged for Palm Sunday processions, decimating once abundant palm groves (P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Wax palms are very long-lived and slow-growing (mature individuals are over 500 years old)<strong> </strong>(Salaman 2001); they suffer poor recruitment  because cattle browse young trees, and logging in adjacent areas  increases their susceptibility to disease (Krabbe 1998<strong></strong>, Salaman <em>et al</em>. 1999a, b, P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 1999)<strong></strong>. Hunting is a further threat, as the species is easily approachable and largely oblivious to humans (Salaman <em>et al</em>. 2019, P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 2019). In Ecuador, hunting for food was prolific<strong> </strong> (Krabbe and Sornoza 1996, Salaman <em>et al</em>. 1999b)<strong></strong>, and trapping has had some impact in Colombia, although the species is notoriously hard to keep in captivity<strong> </strong>(Salaman <em>et al</em>. 1999b, Salaman 2001<strong></strong>)<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><strong></strong>.

The spectacular recovery of the species is the result of an intensive two-decade multifaceted conservation effort by FundaciÃÂ³n ProAves, supported by FundaciÃÂ³n Loro Parque (P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 2019, FundaciÃÂ³n ProAves <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Results from habitat protection and restoration, provision of artificial nest sites, community outreach efforts, a national Palm Sunday campaign (Ã¢ÂÂReconcile with NatureÃ¢ÂÂ) to protect wax palm, community workshops, and among other activities immediately alleviated threats and a population recovery started (P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Awareness campaigns highlight the importance of the wax palm and the species. These campaigns caused people to stop hunting the parrot and felling the palms, and encouraged the government and FARC to enforce a ban on harming the parrot and the palm (P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 2019). In 2003, the head of the Catholic church in Colombia overturned a two-century old tradition of using wax palm fronds in Palm Sunday processions with an immediate and effective nationwide ban on using wax palms (P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Police, military and regional environmental agencies in Colombia conducted nationwide checkpoints to confiscate wax palm fronds (Salaman <em>et al</em>. 2019). Combined with on-the-ground actions such as fencing of breeding sites to allow wax palm regeneration, habitat restoration and provision of artificial nest boxes<strong></strong>, the species's population size has increased significantly<strong></strong> (Salaman 2001, Waugh 2004,<strong> </strong>FundaciÃÂ³n ProAves <em>in litt.</em> 2010, 2012, Salaman <em>et al</em>. 2019)<strong></strong>.

At San Luis de Cubarral, the use of artificial nests was initiated in 2011, and it is reported that the population has increased as a result (<em>per</em> O. Cortes <em> in litt</em>. 2013).

It is undergoing extremely rapid declines, mainly due to the impacts of habitat loss and trapping pressure. It is consequently listed as Critically Endangered.","Recent surveys along the coast of Ecuador have located this species in areas with a presence of both mangrove and dry tropical forest, or algarrobo <em>Prosopis julifora</em> (M. Pilgrim and B.  Biddle <em>in litt</em>. 2013, Biddle <em>et al</em>. 2020, H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species persists in disturbed forest fragments and probably frequents a variety of forest habitats, including dry scrub and modified areas such as plantations (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997). It roosts communally every night, preferably on mangrove islands (Berg and Angel 2006). Breeding has been noted in January-March (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 2016).","Most of Ecuador's forests and mangroves have been cleared since the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, with aquaculture pond development for shrimp farming being the main driver of mangrove loss (B. Biddle <em>in litt</em>. 2014). The clearance and unsustainable use of mangroves may have slowed because of protection measures, but loud bird-scaring devices used at existing shrimp farms are likely to cause disturbance to the species (B. Biddle <em>in litt</em>. 2014). Overall, habitat loss and degradation driven by agricultural expansion, cutting of firewood and development are regarded as on-going threats to this species. Trapping pressure is another on-going threat; it is thought that a large proportion of the communities within the range keep the species as pets (Biddle <em>et al</em>. 2020). The population near Bahia de Caraquez has been severely reduced to the trapping (H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt</em>. 2020).","The roost near Bahia de Caraquez contains roughly 60-116 individuals, equating to 40-80 mature individuals (Biddle <em>et al</em>. 2020). Counts for the roost in Santa Elena fluctuate, with high counts of 2,340 and 2,578 individuals in 2019 and 2020 (H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt</em>. 2020). This roughly equates to up to 1,500-1,700 mature individuals. El Salado Mangrove Reserve holds 32-57 individuals, equating to 20-40 mature individuals. Manglares Churute Ecological Reserve contains 628-729 individuals, equating to 400-490 mature individuals (Biddle <em>et al</em>. 2020). Individuals from Santa Elena, El Salado Mangrove Reserve and Manglares Churute Ecological Reserve are thought to form one subpopulation with around 1,920-2,230 mature individuals, which is disconnected from the subpopulation near Bahia de Caraquez (Biddle <em>et al</em>. 2020). Furthermore, a third very small subpopulation has been identified in El Oro province (Biddle <em>et al</em>. 2020, H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt</em>. 2020). To account for uncertainties due  to fluctuating roost attendance, the population  size is placed in the band 1,000-2,499 mature individuals.","<em>Amazona lilacina</em> is endemic to <strong>Ecuador</strong>, where it occurs along the Pacific coast from El Oro in the south to ManabÃÂ­ in the north. In a detailed field survey, several roosts could be identified (Biddle <em>et al</em>. 2020 and references therein). One roost is located on a mangrove island near Bahia de Caraquez. Further roosts were found in the mangroves of El Salado Mangrove Reserve and Manglares Churute Ecological Reserve and in an algarrobo (<em>Prosopis julifora</em>) forest in Santa Elena province. Another very small roost is located in El Oro province.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p></p>",,<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species occurs within El Salado Mangrove Reserve and Manglares Churute Ecological Reserve.

Remaining habitat is fragmented, and both range and population are thought to be declining. As a result, the species qualifies as Endangered.<p></p>","The species inhabits very humid, tropical forest. It is primarily found from 800-1,300 m, occasionally as low as 300 m and as high as 1,800 m (H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt</em>. 2020). It has been reported to tolerate some habitat fragmentation (Schaefer and Schmidt 2003). It mostly occurs in groups of 4-15 individuals, although a flock of 60 has been observed. It feeds on various fruit (including figs [<em>Ficus</em> sp.]), fruits and <em>Cecropia</em> flowers<strong></strong> (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000). It appears to favour <em>Dacryodes peruviana </em>(Burseraceae) for nesting<strong> </strong>(GarzÃÂ³n and JuiÃÂ±a 2007), but a pair exhibited pre-nesting behaviour in the cavity of a small Meliaceae tree in 1997<strong></strong> (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000). Nests have been reported in natural cavities 1.8-24 m above the ground in a variety of tree species (Schaefer and Schmidt 2003). About 75% of the population breed cooperatively (Klauke <em>et al</em>. 2013). The breeding season lasts from November to March<strong> </strong>(GarzÃÂ³n and JuiÃÂ±a 2007). Seasonal movements to lower altitudinal forests have been reported at Buenaventura<strong> </strong>(H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt. </em>2007). <p></p>","Below 900 m, the rate of deforestation in west Ecuador was 57% per decade in 1958-1988, although in the higher parts of its range, with steeper terrain and a harsher climate, deforestation is slower and a greater proportion of forest remains<strong></strong> (Dodson and Gentry 1991). In particular, rapid rates of logging around PiÃÂ±as and Manta Real occurred during the late 1980s and 1990s (N. Simpson <em>in litt.</em> 2000). Typically, these areas were then burnt for cattle-farming. Mining is an additional threat (H. M. Schaefer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Lack of suitable nesting trees may be a limiting factor and nesting at suboptimal sites may increase predation by species such as Crimson-rumped Toucanet<strong> </strong><em>Aulacorhynchus haematopygus</em><strong> </strong>(Anon. 2006, GarzÃÂ³n and JuiÃÂ±a 2007, Waugh 2007, GarzÃÂ³n <em>et al</em>. 2020)<strong></strong>. Its favoured nesting tree <em>Dacryodes peruviana </em>is highly sought after and frequently targeted for human use<strong> </strong>(GarzÃÂ³n and JuiÃÂ±a 2007).<em> </em>Subpopulations may be isolated due to habitat fragmentation; for example, genetic differentiation was found between groups only 2 km apart (Klauke <em>et al</em>. 2016). Owing to the cooperative breeding system, only ~50% of mature individuals reproduce in a given breeding season. The species suffers from limited genetic diversity, as reproductive output is directly related to the genetic diversity of flocks (Klauke <em>et al.</em> 2013). Inbreeding is known to occur, although its effects are unclear (H. M. Schaefer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2020). Climate change is apparently causing a very pronounced upslope shift in distribution (now 900-1,800 m within the Buenaventura valley where it was originally 600-1,100 m in the 1980s; Klauke <em>et al.</em> 2016), with a corresponding drastic shrinking of distribution size and available habitat similar to Ecuadorian Tapaculo (Hermes <em>et al. </em>2017).<p></p>","The largest population is found at Buenaventura Reserve, where a population size of 171 individuals was estimated in 2005-2006<strong> </strong>(GarzÃÂ³n and JuiÃÂ±a 2007, H. M. Schaefer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012), and 300 in 2014 (Waugh 2014) and c. 250-260 in 2019 (GarzÃÂ³n <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Outside of Buenaventura, a survey recorded maximum numbers of 77 individuals in ÃÂalacapac, 97 in Palo Solo and 80 in Paccha (EcheverrÃÂ­a and GarzÃÂ³n 2016). The population in El Oro province is currently estimated at 550-609 individuals, with an additional 86-91 individuals in Azuay province (GarzÃÂ³n <em>et al</em>. 2019). The species's cooperative breeding system means that the number of breeding birds may be significantly fewer (H. M. Schaefer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). It is thus best placed in the band 250-999 mature individuals, which equates to 375-1,499 individuals in total, rounded here to 350-1,500 individuals.","<em>Pyrrhura orcesi</em> occurs on the west slope of the Andes in south-west <strong>Ecuador</strong> (El Oro and Azuay), where it was discovered in 1980. It is apparently confined to an area only 100 km from north to south, and a maximum of 5-10 km wide<strong> </strong>(Juniper and Parr 1998), containing highly fragmented habitat, and with a population estimated at fewer than 1,000 individuals<strong> </strong>(GarzÃÂ³n and JuiÃÂ±a 2007).

The difference in tail length between nominate <em>sumatranus </em>and <em>sangirensis</em> yields an efect size of 3.70. Both these findings point to the distinctness and validity of the forms <em>burbidgii</em> and <em>sangirensis</em>; <em>burbidgii</em> is larger in all dimensions than any other taxon except the little-known <em>freeri</em> (see below), while <em>sangirensis</em> almost matches it for wing length and almost matches <em>everetti </em>for tail length while exactly matching nominate <em>sumatranus</em> for bill length. It is also worth noting that the four Peleng and Banggai birds proved to have shorter wings and tails than any other taxa, and that the four Sula birds had larger bills than either <em>sumatranus</em> or <em>sangirensis</em>. Additionally, phylogenetic reconstruction identified the Philippine and Indonesian clades as being as genetically distinct as <em>T. lucionensis </em>and <em>T. megalorynchos</em>.","This species has a very large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence &lt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup> combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). The population is suspected to be declining, however the rate of decline does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size has not been quantified, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","The species inhabits lowland forests, including lower montane areas, as well as forest edges, areas of cleared land, peatlands, freshwater swamps, and savannas (Collar and Boesman 2020).

Thus, the species is thought to exist in a very small and restricted population, at present confined to Samar, and Mindanao, with the stronghold of the population residing on Tawi-Tawi of the Sulu Islands. Major threats such as deforestation and habitat degradation as well as ongoing trapping for trade are also contributing to a continuing decline. If further surveys suggests that the population is far lower than considered however, the species may require uplisting in the future.","Very little is known about the ecology of the species, albeit it is likely to occur in similar habitats to the Azure-rumped Parrot <em>Tanygnathus sumatranus</em>. The species may therefore occur across tropical, lowland, and montane forests, as well as mangrove swamps and degraded forests (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997).","Trapping of adults and nestlings for the cagebird and pet trade are the most significant threats, with heavy trapping particularly extensive in the early 2000s (P. Widmann <em>in litt</em>. 2020, S. Mahood <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Scarcity of captured birds in markets (D. Gutierrez <em>per </em>N. Collar&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020) also suggests the genuine rarity of the species. There is also some level of forest loss across the species' range (Global Forest Watch 2020). Mining activities also continue to reduce habitats across Tawi-Tawi (D. Allen <em>in litt</em>. 2020).","The population is thought to be highly fragmented and extremely rare (L. M. J.

Widmann <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Accounting for the lack of species's records in recent years however, the population is placed here in the band of 250-999 mature individuals, roughly converted to 375-1500 individuals.","<em>Tanygnathus everetti </em>has a restricted range, occurring only on parts of Samar, Mindanao, and Tawi-Tawi (Sulu Islands), <strong>Philippines</strong> (Arndt <em>et al</em>. 2019, eBird 2020, P.

Widmann&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020, J. Eaton <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Records for example have been extremely scarce or even absent on Polillo, Samar, Panay (although the Aklan region, covering a third of the forests in the Central Panay mountains have not been recently surveyed; L.

On Mindanao, where the species was easily seen between 2003-2005, with roosts (holding up to 20 birds) being regularly encountered, in recent 2010-2020 surveys, the species has not been sighted at more than 2 individuals in any one time. There has only been one sighting from forests near Senator Ninoy Aquino and occasional sightings from Surigao del Sur on Mindanao, albeit other areas with suitable forest habitats may be under-surveyed, particularly across lowland regions (R.

In Mexico, parrot trade was banned in 2008, but before then the species was trapped legally (CantÃÂº <em>et al</em>. 2007, J. C. CantÃÂº <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Between 1998 and 2008, over 8,000 individuals were legally captured, making it the second-most captured parrot species in Mexico (J. C. CantÃÂº <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Since the ban in 2008, illegal capturing is still ongoing in Mexico, albeit decreasing in recent years (CantÃÂº <em>et al</em>. 2007, J. C. CantÃÂº <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Trapping has also been recorded in Costa Rica and El Salvador (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). A further threat is habitat loss and degradation; however due to its tolerance of converted habitats the species is not severely affected by habitat destruction (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020).","The global population is estimated to number 500,000-4,999,999 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2019).","The species occurs along the Pacific slope of western Central America, from Sinaloa (<strong>Mexico</strong>) to north-western <strong>Costa Rica</strong>.",,<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/><strong></strong>CITES Appendix II.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/><strong></strong>Monitor the population size and trend.

It nests in tree-cavities (especially in pine snags and <em>Pseudotsuga menziesii</em><strong> </strong>[M. A. Cruz-Nieto<em> in litt.</em> 1998; Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004]), often originally excavated by woodpeckers. The selection of tree species in which pairs nest appears to shift in reaction to changes in local availability (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004)<strong></strong>. Breeding coincides with the peak in production of pine-seeds, which are the species's primary food resource (Ortiz Maciel and Cruz Nieto 2004)<strong></strong>. The egg-laying period is mid-June to late July (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004)<strong></strong>. Flocks roost on cliffs, but reintroduced birds have used trees.

Historically, there has been an extensive modification of old-growth pine forests for timber and woodpulp. In the Sierra Madre Occidental, 80-85% of forest cover remains, but only 0.6% is old-growth (Lammertink <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. In 1994, there was extensive penetration and degradation of habitat in south Chihuahua by drug-growers, loggers and huge numbers of cattle. In the same year, forest stands at Mesa de Guacamayas were heavily burned (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004)<strong></strong>. Logging has been intensive in the Sierra Madre Occidental, with no large fragments of old growth forest remaining in northern areas (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004)<strong></strong>. Commercial logging in the area involves the removal of larger trees and standing dead wood, and appears to reduce nest-site availability by leaving few snags and pine trees large enough for the species to nest in. Such large-scale logging operations across the species's historic range may be responsible for its decline (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004)<strong></strong>. As a result of habitat loss, the breeding strongholds are now concentrated in two areas; Cebadillas de Yahuirachi and Madera (Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. Fire remains a serious threat to the species (M. A. Cruz-Nieto <em>et al.</em> <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. <br/> Illegal trade in the species has fluctuated with peaks in the early 1970s and mid-1980s. Unofficial records confirm that the species is taken for illegal trade, but the extent of trapping is not known (M. A. Cruz-Nieto <em>et al.</em> <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. <br/>Climate change may have an impact on habitat availability for this species, particularly during the breeding season: depending on the climate change scenario, the climatically suitable area for the species may shrink to only 25-70% of the current extent by 2090 (Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al. </em>2015).<br/><p></p>","In 2004, the population was thought to number 3,000-6,000 individuals, although more recent systematic counts gave a potential global population of 2,097 individuals (Cruz-Nieto <em>et al. </em>2012). According to Ortiz-Maciel and Cruz-Nieto (2004), an estimate of up to 140 nests in the Bisaloachic-Cebadillas region represented c.10% of the total known  breeding population then, which equates to 2,800 mature individuals. However, these figures may represent an over-estimate, as not all of the  nest cavities surveyed are used every year (M. A. Cruz-Nieto<em> et al. in litt.</em> 2007). Surveys in 2011 found 177 breeding pairs, estimated to be potentially 42% of the breeding population (Cruz-Nieto <em>et al. </em>2011), which equates to roughly 840 mature individuals. Systematic counts in 2012 gave a potential global population of 2,097 individuals <span class=""GramE""><span class=""GramE"">(Cruz-Nieto&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012).

In 2003-2004, the Madera nesting area (the second most important breeding area) was in the process of being declared a National Forest Reserve, and efforts were underway for the protection of Mesa de Guacamayas (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004)<strong></strong>. In 2002, a moratorium on timber extraction was signed by the Tutuaca Ejido at Bisaloachia (Cebadillas), which will protect 10% of the breeding population for 15 years (Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2000; Lurie and Snyder 2001; Ortiz-Maciel and Cruz-Nieto 2004)<strong></strong>.

There has been an illicit pet trade (Primot 2000) which is thought to have increased through the second half of the 20th century (Robinet <em>et al. </em>1995).&#160;Nesting holes are cut open to extract the nestlings, rendering them unsuitable for future breeding attempts and a lack of nesting sites is believed to be a limiting factor. The continuous presence of local guides is believed to be effectively preventing nest poaching (BarrÃÂ© <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010), although it has been reported that some poaching effort appears to have resumed, including the illegal culling of birds in gardens (J. Theuerkauf <em>in litt. </em>2017, 2020). The invasion of the island in 1996 by bees, which compete for tree holes, is a significant threat, with 10-16% of known nests being occupied by bees in 2000-2002 (N. BarrÃÂ© <em>in litt. </em>2003). The native Brown Goshawk <em>Accipiter fasciatus,</em> and perhaps other predators, are believed to take many juveniles (Robinet <em>et al.</em> 1996; N. BarrÃÂ© <em>in litt.</em> 1999; P. Primot <em>in litt.</em> 1999; Robinet and Salas 1999)<strong></strong>. Suitable habitat is patchy and fragmented mainly as a result of coconut plantations, which do not afford protection from predation by <em>A. fasciatus</em> and so act as barriers to dispersal. Two Black Rats,&#160;<em>Rattus rattus,</em>&#160;have recently been trapped near the harbour, although there is no evidence that the species has yet become established on the island (J. Theuerkauf <em>in litt.</em> 2016, 2017). Previously, experiments showed that egg-predation rates were four times higher on the island of Lifou, where <em>R. rattus </em>was present, compared to Ouvea, where they were absent (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 1998). The introduced Rainbow Lorikeet&#160;<em>Trichoglossus</em>&#160;<em>haematodus </em>may pose a threat through competition (although it has different habitat and dietary requirements so competition is unlikely), or through transmission of Beak and Feather Disease virus (BFDV) (Jackson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).","The population is estimated to number&#160;1,730 mature individuals in total (Legault <em>et al.</em> 2013), rounded here to 1,700 mature individuals.","<em>Eunymphicus uvaeensis</em> is restricted to Ouvea, <strong>New Caledonia (to France)</strong>, where most birds occur in c.20 km<sup>2</sup> of forest in the north, although c.60 km<sup>2</sup> of habitat remains (Robinet <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. Earlier population estimates have been alarmingly low, but populations in the north and south of the island are regularly surveyed and data show a steady increase in both areas (L.

The population has steadily increased from an estimated c.600 birds in 1993 (Robinet <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong> and 824 birds in 1999 (Primot 1999) until reaching a plateau with 2090 birds in 2009 (Barre <em>et al.</em> 2010), and 1730 in 2013 (Legault <em>et al.</em> 2013).

The Association for the Protection of the OuvÃÂ©a Parakeet (ASPO) was created in 1993 with mostly local members. The ASPO initiated a long-term study of the biology and ecology of the species as a basis for two recovery plans (1997-2002 and 2003-2008). Forest loss is being addressed through community awareness programmes and trials to mitigate habitat degradation and improve forest quality, particularly with regard to nest-sites. Ten guides are employed, who, amongst other duties, locate nests. Illegal trade is being successfully tackled by increased awareness and law enforcement. A captive-breeding programme has been discussed but not yet started, with the species occuring only in small numbers in captivity with very limited breeding success (Robinet 1996). A translocation programme to restock the south of Ouvea was initiated in 1998, and the number of birds in the south stood at&#160;395&#160;individuals in 2011 (J.

Incubation is conducted solely by  the female, although post-hatching care is biparental (DÃÂ­az 2006).<br/><p></p>","The major threat to the species is forest loss for cattle pasture  and selective logging for timber and  firewood (Renjifo <em>et al</em>. 2014). Most mature trees with natural cavities have been logged, creating a shortage of natural nesting sites. Clearance of forest in the region of the type-locality was already extensive in 1911, and it is estimated that the species has lost almost 50% of its original habitat (Renjifo <em>et al</em>. 2014). Deforestation rates have however slowed down considerably in recent  years, amounting to &lt;1% over the past ten years (Global Forest Watch  2021). A large gold reserve was discovered close to a key population, however, the threat of deforestation was mitigated when FundaciÃÂ³n ProAves purchased and protected 294 ha of critical habitat (FundaciÃÂ³n ProAves <em>per </em>P.

Its population is now extremely small, and despite high dispersal abilities the population exhibits a small-scale structuring into four different subpopulations. It therefore qualifies as Critically Endangered.<br/><p></p>","Its original natural habitat is inter-Andean dry forest, but this has been degraded to thorn and cactus scrub by centuries (if not millennia) of human activity<strong> </strong>(S. K. Herzog <em>in litt. </em>2007) and it now inhabits subtropical, xerophytic thorny scrub with many cacti and scattered trees at 1,100-2,700 m, dispersing locally to 3,000 m. It nests and roosts on undisturbed, steep-sided river cliffs, with a small population breeding in palms (Rojas <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012). Its diet includes seeds and fruit, but natural food sources are often scarce and birds feed extensively on crops, particularly groundnuts and unripe maize (Kyle 2005). Egg-laying takes place in February and March, with pairs fledging one, two or occasionally three offspring annually<strong> </strong>(Juniper and Parr 1998; S. K. Herzog <em>in litt. </em>2007; A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012; Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). Adults and their young remain on the breeding grounds until May, after which they congregate in a few large flocks in agricultural areas  and roost communally in large trees (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012). Even though the breeding sites are separated by only 10-60 km and  individuals from different colonies forage together outside of the  breeding season, the species shows a clear genetic sub-structure with  almost no gene flow between colonies, which has been attributed to a  strong natal phylopatry (J. L. Tella <em>in litt.</em> 2017; Blanco <em>et al</em>. 2021). <p></p>","Its original natural habitat is inter-Andean dry forest but this has been degraded to thorn and cactus scrub by centuries (if not millennia) of highly unsustainable human activities, nowadays mainly overgrazing by goats, firewood cutting and charcoal production<strong> </strong>(S. K. Herzog <em>in litt. </em>2007). An estimated 40% of natural vegetation in valleys within its range had been converted to agriculture by 1991, with other areas degraded by intense grazing. Several important food trees are harvested for fuel and charcoal. As food plants are lost, agricultural land is used more, thereby increasing the species's exposure to persecution as a crop-pest, and the use of firearms for pest control has been recorded<strong> </strong>(Brace <em>et al.</em> 1995). Macaws are also potentially threatened by pesticides applied to crops where macaws forage mostly during the non-breeding season (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012). <br/>Illegal trapping continues, but has been reduced as a result of legal protection<strong></strong> (Pitter and Christiansen 1995; <strong></strong>Juniper and Parr 1998; Herrera and Hennessey 2007;<strong> </strong>A. Rojas <em>in litt. </em>2007). The majority of the Bolivian parrot trade is domestic, but more valuable threatened species end up in Peru or further afield. 26 Red-fronted Macaws were recorded passing through the Los Pozos pet market, Santa Cruz between August 2004-July 2005, and there are four other wildlife markets in the city and others in Cochabamba, suggesting this figure may only represent a small proportion of birds illegally trafficked in the country<strong> </strong>(Herrera and Hennessey 2007). In 2011, 45 Red-fronted Macaws were recorded in houses; some had been taken from nests as nestlings, but most of them were trapped when foraging in crops. In 2017, more than 100 individuals were found as cage birds in local communities (J. L. Tella <em>in litt.</em> 2017). Most were kept as pets, but some were to sell to in major cities (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012). The two main threats appear to be nest-poaching and trapping for local pet supply, and persecution as crop pests (especially in corn and peanut cultivations), and possibly contamination by pesticides applied to crops  (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012; J. L. Tella <em>in litt</em>. 2017). <br/><p></p>","The population is estimated to number at most 600-800 individuals. Taking the most precautionary approach, including only the  currently-breeding individuals results in a population estimate of  approximately 134-272 mature individuals.<br/><br/>Despite its high dispersal abilities and no geographic barriers, the population shows a significant genetic structuring among the four colonies, with almost no gene flow due to strong natal phylopatry (Blanco <em>et al</em>. 2021). The species is therefore assessed as forming four very small subpopulations.","<em>Ara rubrogenys</em> is endemic to a small area on the east Andean slope of south-central <strong>Bolivia</strong>, from south Cochabamba and west Santa Cruz through north Chuquisaca to north-east PotosÃÂ­. It is principally found in the valley systems of the rÃÂ­os Grande, Mizque, Caine and Pilcomayo. It is locally common but declining, with the population variously estimated at 2,000-4,000 individuals in 1991-1992 (Pitter and Christiansen 1995), or as few as 1,000 in 1991 (Clarke and Duran PatiÃÂ±o 1991). In the Caine valley (Cochabamba and PotosÃÂ­) 40-100 individuals were considered resident and secure in 1989-1992, but only one was seen during five days of fieldwork in 1995<strong></strong> (Pitter and Christiansen 1995;<strong> </strong>Herzog <em>et al.</em> 1997). Conservative estimates in 2007 indicated there were fewer than 500 breeding pairs, although not all nesting colonies had been found, and there were additional non-breeding adults in any given year<strong> </strong>(S. K. Herzog <em>in litt. </em>2007). A survey conducted in 2011 (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012) attempted to cover the entire range of the species, locating 34-35 occupied nesting sites in cliffs, of which 16 were previously unknown, as well as a small population breeding in palms (Rojas <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012). The survey counted 130 pairs, of which 67-86 were breeding and the rest probably did not attempt to breed (immature pairs). Non-breeding individuals were aggregated in 7 localities during the breeding season and consisted of 545 individuals, giving a total population (including pairs) of 805 individuals (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012). This survey also showed that 5 out of 28 (18%) of breeding locations known from the previous five years were unoccupied in 2011 (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012). In a precautionary approach including only the currently-breeding individuals, the number of mature individuals was estimated at 134-272. <br/><p></p>","Illegal trapping continues, but has been reduced as a result of legal protection<strong></strong> (Pitter and Christiansen 1995; <strong></strong>Juniper and Parr 1998; Herrera and Hennessey 2007;<strong> </strong>A.

It is considered nationally Critically Endangered in Bolivia (Rojas<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2009). Its capture, transport and export is prohibited under Bolivian law (Fuller and Gaski 1987)<strong></strong>, although this is not effectively enforced<strong> </strong>(Herrera and Hennessey 2007). Non-breeding birds occur in the southern edge of Amboro National Park<strong> </strong>(S. K. Herzog <em>in litt. </em>2007; A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012). Two municipal protected areas have been created at Pasorapa (1,796 km<sup>2</sup>) and Mollepampa-Lagarpampa (303 km<sup>2</sup>) (J. Cahill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). ArmonÃÂ­a has a long-term conservation project on the Rio Mizque working with three subsistence farming communities to protect a breeding cliff with 11-13 active nests  (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012). An ecotourism lodge was inaugurated here in 2006 with proceeds going to the local communities <strong></strong>(S. K. Herzog <em>in litt. </em>2007). In 1992, 5,000 posters urging the protection of macaws and their habitat  were made and apparently well received throughout the region. Educational campaigns are ongoing to raise awareness for the species, to discourage trapping and trade and to recruit local communities into conservation projects (ArmonÃÂ­a 2015; Salguero Colque<em> et al</em>. 2019). Community projects aim at creating alternative sources of income for the local population, including honey production and papaya cultivation (ArmonÃÂ­a 2015). There are significant numbers of the species at the Santa Cruz Zoo in Bolivia and at  zoos and in private holdings outside Bolivia (J. D. Gilardi <em>in litt.</em>  2012), but no formal management plan for these birds. An action plan has been derived in 2019, but has not been formally adopted yet (Sierra Praeli 2020).<br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue surveying and monitoring of the population. Identify suitable sites for protected areas throughout the species's range (Kyle 2005; A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012). Fence key patches of gallery forest to limit cattle-grazing and permit vegetation to regenerate<strong> </strong>(Snyder <em>et al. </em>2000). Effectively enforce trade laws<strong> </strong>(Herrera and Hennessey 2007). Continue organising awareness campaigns (Clarke and Duran PatiÃÂ±o 1991). Expand education programmes to reduce nest-poaching and trapping. Assess the costs of compensating crop damage to avoid persecution of macaws in agricultural areas, and investigate alternatives to resolve the conflict between agriculture and macaw conservation as the main threat for the species (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012). Approve the action plan created in 2019. Create a management plan for captive birds in <em>ex-situ</em> conservation, involving Bolivia and foreign countries, and incorporate pets and illegally traded birds into this programme (J. D.

MotacÃÂº palm <em>Attalea phalerata</em> is a principal food of all macaws in the area, with abundances ranging from 0-100% in forest islands in the savannas, and borders of gallery forest. It nests in cavities, hatching 1-3 eggs. Birds living in the north of the&#160;Llanos de Mojos breed around the end of the dry season (September and October) whilst birds in the south breed at the beginning of the wet season (November onwards) (Berkunsky <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Preferred nesting cavities typically have a diameter of 30 cm or more and are found in trees with a diameter at breast height of 60 cm or more (Gould 2013a). The species is most frequently found in pairs, but small groups (7-9) do occur and one large roosting group of 70 is known, thought to be made up of non-breeding birds (I. Berkunsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012; J. Gilardi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). <br/><p></p>","The species was severely threatened in the past by legal and illegal exploitation for the national and international cage-bird trade (A. Hesse <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>1999; I. Berkunsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012), although this has been radically reduced since 1984 (I. Berkunsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Nevertheless, in 2010 illegal trading of two recently-poached wild juvenile Blue-throated Macaws was uncovered&#160;(Berkunsky&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). The juveniles were eventually released into the wild, however this demonstrates that illegal poaching does still occur.<br/> All known breeding sites are on private cattle-ranches, where burning and clearing for pasture and tree-felling for fuel and fence posts have reduced the number of suitable nest trees and inhibited palm regeneration<strong> </strong>(Duffield and Hesse 1997; Hesse 1998; J. Gilardi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. Cattle-rearing has occurred in the region since the 17th century (A. Hesse <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>1999); thus, the preferred food, the motacÃÂº palm <em>Attalea phalerata</em>, has been substantially reduced and is only regenerating slowly (B. Hennessey <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Nest-site competition from other macaws, toucans, bats and large woodpeckers is significant, and disturbance from mammals, birds and human activity may reduce the reproductive output of some pairs (J. Gilardi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Between 2007 and 2012, 30 nests were monitored. Of these nests, 57% failed, with most failures occurring during incubation (Berkunsky <em>et al</em>. 2014). Reasons for nest failure were diverse but included disease, predation and abandonment. Botfly (<em>Philornis</em> spp.) infestations have been responsible for nest failures as have bees colonising nest sites, extreme weather events and parental neglect (Gould 2013a). Nestlings are vulnerable to predation from Toco Toucan <em>Ramphastos toco</em>, Crane Hawk <em>Geranospiza caerulescens</em>, Great-horned Owl <em>Bubo virginianus&#160;</em>and Southern-crested Caracara <em>Caracara plancus</em> (Gould 2013a). Hunting to provide feathers for indigenous headdresses probably has an important impact in some areas (I. Berkunsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). <br/>There are fears that inbreeding within an increasingly fragmented population is resulting in reduced fertility<strong></strong> (Loro Parque FundaciÃÂ³n 2003). This is compounded by a lack of recruitment to the breeding population; during a five year study, no new breeding pairs were recruited (Berkunsky&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Disease also represents a significant threat, particularly in areas where the species shares water sources with other bird species (Gould 2013a). A Population Viability Analysis found that changes in adult mortality had the greatest impact on estimates of extinction probability and population growth rates and that habitat loss and poaching also affected these estimates (Strem and Bouzat 2012).<p></p>","Based on comprehensive surveys carried out during the dry season in 2015 across the entire range, and extrapolating the number of individuals detected over the area of suitable habitat, the global population was estimated to number 312-455 individuals (Herzog <em>et al</em>. 2020). This equates to 208-303 mature individuals. Among these, 156-222 individuals are breeding or attempting to breed (Herzog <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Based on current occurrence records, the species is assumed to form three disjunct subpopulations: The north-western subpopulation occurs west of the MarmorÃÂ© river between Santa Rosa de Yacuma and Santa Ana de Yacuma; the north-eastern subpopulation occurs east of the MarmorÃÂ© river and north of Trinidad; the southern subpopulation is found south of Trinidad, around and south of Loreto (Herzog <em>et al</em>. 2020). The sizes of each subpopulation have not been estimated in detail, but they are likely extremely small, numbering below 50 mature individuals each. Excluding repeat observations of the same individuals, count data report up to 25 individuals in the north-western subpopulation, up to 16 individuals in the north-eastern subpopulation and up to 21 individuals in the southern subpopulation (Herzog <em>et al</em>. 2020).","<em>Ara glaucogularis</em> is known from the Llanos de Mojos in north <strong>Bolivia</strong>. It is found from  west of Santa Ana eastwards across the upper rÃÂ­o MamorÃÂ©, Beni, where the wild population was discovered in 1992<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Duffield and Hesse 1997; Yamashita and Barros 1997), to the eastern  savannas; the southern subpopulation is found mostly in the MarabÃÂ¡n  province in Beni, close to the town of Loreto (Herzog <em>et al</em>. 2020).

Officially considered Critically Endangered at the national level in Bolivia (Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Agua 2009). AsociaciÃÂ³n ArmonÃÂ­a/Loro Parque FundaciÃÂ³n produced a Blue-throated Macaw Recovery Plan in 2003. It was listed as endangered under the U.S.A. Endangered Species Act in November 2013 (Gould 2013b). Live export from Bolivia was banned in 1984, although illegal export was still evident in 1997 (Duffield and Hesse 1997). The AsociaciÃÂ³n ArmonÃÂ­a/Loro Parque FundaciÃÂ³n parrot trade monitoring project has recorded reduced levels of trade in the species<strong> </strong>(B. Hennessey <em>in litt. </em>2008), but the large scale illegal trade infrastructure in Bolivia means there is the potential to start trapping again if there is the demand. Agreement has been reached with some landowners to control access and deter potential trappers, and negotiations with other landowners continue<strong> </strong>(Hesse 1998; A. Hesse <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1999). Based on field surveys, recommendations have been made that the Paraparau region, Beni department, be given greater conservation priority (Tobias 2003).<br/><br/>Much of the remaining population occurs on private ranch-lands. Many landowners are sympathetic to conservation work on their lands and continued support will benefit the species's recovery. Local conservation work has involved planting trees that provide food for the species (Gould 2013a) and a&#160;nest box campaign which has been run since 2004 and has found that there is a great demand for suitable nesting cavities. The active management and monitoring of nest box use has helped to reduce the incidence of nest failure. A recent study found that birds more readily used nest boxes that were placed in the same tree, or very near to a nest site used in previous years (Berkunsky <em>et al</em>. 2014). <br/><br/>AsociaciÃÂ³n ArmonÃÂ­a, with the help of the American Bird Conservancy and World Land Trust, completed the purchase of a 3,555 ha private reserve protecting at least 20 Blue-throated Macaw in November 2008<strong>&#160;</strong>(BirdLife International 2008). The Barba Azul Nature Reserve protects important foraging and roosting sites for over 100 Blue-throated Macaw individuals from March to early November (AsociaciÃÂ³n ArmonÃÂ­a <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). With additional land purchases, the Barba Azul Nature Reserve was expanded to almost 11,000 ha in 2014 (Anon. 2014b). The reserve is used for education, research and tourism. In 2018, the Laney Rickman Nature Reserve was created, covering an area of 680 ha (American Bird Conservancy 2018). AsociaciÃÂ³n ArmonÃÂ­a started a nest-box programme in their reserves in 2005; since then a total of 93 chicks fledged successfully (AsociaciÃÂ³n ArmonÃÂ­a 2020). The World Land Trust also carries out nest-box provision, as well as the feeding of nestlings and other manipulations. Nest guarding and monitoring has also been introduced at nests that are particularly vulnerable to predation (Gould 2013a). Other measures include on-going surveys of potential areas where populations may persist; a pet trade monitoring programme in two main Bolivian cities, land acquisition programmes conducted in order to protect key habitat and populations, as well as reforestation programmes for the MotacÃÂº palm. There has been a widespread education programme, including pamphlets, posters, T-shirts, presentations, short-wave radio spots, video programmes, TV interviews, travel to the most remote ranches giving presentations on laptops, and creation of interpretation centres in the bottle-neck towns of Trinidad, Santa Rosa and Santa Ana. Artificial feathers have been successfully produced and marketed to local people to replace authentic Blue-throated Macaw feathers used in traditional headdresses (Anon. 2014a). <br/><br/>The population in captivity (some of which is held in captive-breeding facilities) is many times larger than the wild population.&#160;In 2009 a formal agreement was signed between the Loro Parque FundaciÃÂ³n, AsociaciÃÂ³n ArmonÃÂ­a, the Zoo Fauna Sudamericana and the Noel Kempff Mercado Natural History Museum which formalises the initiation of a managed cooperative breeding programme in Bolivia (Anon. 2008). Modelling the effect of different management strategies on the population dynamics showed that the reintroduction of 50 adult individuals would double the wild population within 10 years (Maestri <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Monitor the population to quantify the current trend. Track movements during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. Study the species's habitat requirements. Investigate post-breeding behaviour: a study from 2007 to 2012  suggested that successful pairs do not breed the following year and more  work is needed to ascertain how common this behaviour is (Berkunsky <em>et al</em>. 2014). Conduct research on MotacÃÂº palm to  understand how to manage and regenerate the habitat (Gould 2013a). Implement field research to identify principal health threats. Continue illegal pet trade monitoring and confiscations of all native parrots from traders. <br/><br/>Continue nest guarding and monitoring. Promote the acquisition of land for the species's long-term  conservation. Expand the reserves and protect suitable habitat. Expand and improve the nest box programme. Promote habitat restoration.

J. Sharpe&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011, 2021; Rojas-SuÃÂ¡rez and RodrÃÂ­guez 2015). In Venezuela, this species is the 4<sup>th</sup> most traded parrot (SÃÂ¡nchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2020). Individuals are widely exploited for trade, serving a strong internal pet market; many chicks taken in Bonaire are believed to end up in CuraÃÂ§ao (R. Martin and S. Williams <em>in litt.</em> 2007; Martin 2009). Additionally, in some areas it is hunted for allegedly damaging crops (RodrÃÂ­guez and Rojas-SuÃÂ¡rez 1995; Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000; BriceÃÂ±o-Linares <em>et al</em>. 2011; Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). Negative attitudes due to its perception as a crop pest in agricultural  and urban areas of Bonaire may encourage persecution and undermine  support for conservation efforts (R. Martin and S. Williams <em>in litt.</em> 2012).<br/>Habitat loss and degradation are a further threat. An impoverishment of food resources and lack of mature trees for nest sites  are feared to limit the effective population size. Tourist and associated developments are destroying habitat, especially on Margarita, where the principal breeding, roosting and feeding-sites are threatened by unregulated mining for construction materials (Collar 1997; Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong></strong>. Dry forests and spiny scrub cover have become extensively reduced on Margarita and are now considered to be among the most endangered ecosystems on this island (Provita <em>in litt</em>. 2020). On Bonaire, natural vegetation has been heavily degraded historically  for timber and charcoal production, and more recently through intensive  grazing by goats and donkeys, drastically reducing natural food species  diversity and availability (A. O. Debrot <em>in litt</em>. 1999, 2007)<strong></strong>. In the eastern part of the mainland range, habitat is being lost through timber extraction and urban and industrial development (V. S. D'Angelo <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). Habitat modification for aquaculture and shrimp farming is an emerging threat in the western part of the mainland range (E. Blanco <em>per </em>Provita <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160; <br/>Introduced mammalian predators appear to limit its reproductive potential on Bonaire (R. Martin and S. Williams <em>in litt.</em> 2007; Martin 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Also on La Blanquilla, introduced predators including domestic cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) are feared to drive a population decline (Provita <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<br/><p></p>","The overall population size is unclear and difficult to assess. The subpopulation on Margarita Island was estimated at 1,600 individuals in 2019 (J. M. BriceÃÂ±o-Linares <em>per </em>Provita <em>in litt</em>. 2020), which equates to roughly 1,000 mature individuals. The subpopulation on Bonaire numbered around 700 individuals in 2017 (DCNA 2018), equating to 450 mature individuals. The most recent estimate from La Blanquilla is from 1996-1998, when the island held around 100 individuals (Sanz and RodrÃÂ­guez-Ferraro 2006), equating to roughly 60 mature individuals. The subpopulation in north-western Venezuela was estimated at over 5,000 individuals in 2012 (V. Sanz <em>in litt.</em> 2016), equating to roughly 3,300 mature individuals. In view of the ongoing threats, it is suspected that this subpopulation has declined since then (Ferrer-Paris <em>et al</em>. 2014). There are no estimates for the subpopulation in north-eastern Venezuela, but based on observational records (eBird 2021), it is may be smaller than the north-western subpopulation (Ferrer-Paris <em>et al</em>. 2014). Based on the available values for the subpopulation sizes, assuming that the subpopulation in north-western Venezuela is now below 3,300 mature individuals, and accounting for a subpopulation of unknown size in north-eastern Venezuela, it is preliminarily inferred that the total population numbers between 2,500 and 9,999 mature individuals.&#160; <br/>The species is assumed to form five subpopulations; on Bonaire, La  Blanquilla, Margarita, in north-western Venezuela and north-eastern  Venezuela. It is thought that the largest subpopulation is found in north-western Venezuela (C. Sharpe <em>in litt</em>. 2021), which numbered up to 3,300 mature individuals in 2012 but has likely declined since then.

An amnesty of captive birds took place in 2002, with all declared birds  identified using a numbered ring on the leg to aid in anti-poaching law  enforcement (R. Martin and S.

In 2010, the NGO Echo Bonaire was established to address threats through research and monitoring. Habitat restoration in ongoing; in 2006 and 2007, reforestation of the Washington-Slagbaai park began by successful reintroduction of rare native drought-resistant berry and fruit bearing tree species. In 2007, a fence to exclude goats from a large section of the park was restored (A. O. Debrot <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Supplemental feeding has also been carried out during extreme droughts (A. O. Debrot <em>in litt</em>. 1999, 2007). In 2011  and 2012, 24 captive-reared birds were released on Bonaire (R. Martin and S. Williams <em>in litt.</em> 2012). A species management plan for the Dutch Caribbean has been produced (Williams 2012).<br/>Conservation programmes on Margarita and La Blanquilla are led by Provita. A reintroduction programme was preceded  by five years of environmental education, public awareness and  ecological studies (Sanz and Grajal 1998)<strong></strong>. As a result of this programme, 1,584 chicks have been released since 1990 (Provita <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Awareness-raising campaigns on Margarita and La Blanquilla are ongoing (Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000; Rojas-SuÃÂ¡rez and RodrÃÂ­guez 2015). On Margarita, artificial nests were introduced but were used very infrequently (J. P. Rodriguez <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016)&#160;and suffered higher rates of poaching. The repair of natural nesting cavities has proved more successful (Sanz <em>et al</em>. 2003); Provita carry out guarding of nest sites to protect nestlings from poachers and allow them to fledge. Attempts to establish a protected area on Macanao Peninsula in western Margarita have failed to gain approval from authorities, even though they were supported by public backing (GuillÃÂ©n Montero 2015).

It is therefore listed as Endangered.<p></p>","It is restricted to deciduous or semi-deciduous dry forest growing on limestone outcrops or limestone derived soils. This <em>caatinga</em> type habitat is an isolated island within surrounding <em>cerrado</em> savannah, pasture and agricultural lands. Dry forest typically has a closed canopy and dense understorey with lianas and some cacti, particularly in disturbed areas. The species has been seen in degraded and fragmented forest patches (Olmos <em>et al</em>. 1997). It leaves forest to feed in rice fields, on planted fruits such as mangoes and guava, and on seeds in degraded areas such as abandoned pastures and road verges (Bianchi 2010, Dornas and Pinheiro 2018). It does not&#160;usually venture more than 300 m outside forest with limestone outcrops (Bianchi 2010), although a small flock has been recorded 1.5 km from the nearest forest with limestone outcrops (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018). It feeds on flowers, fruits and seeds, sometimes on the ground and typically in groups.&#160;It also consumes minerals obtained from the rocky walls of the limestone outcrops or from the banks of small rivers and streams (Dornas <em>et al. </em>2016). It breeds between October and January (Bianchi 2008).<p></p>","The principal threat to this species is deforestation driven by selective logging, fires and habitat conversion to pasture or soybean plantations (Olmos <em>et al</em>. 1997; Bianchi 2008). Dry forest in GoiÃÂ¡s decreased in extent from 15.8 % of the state in 1990 to only 5.8 % in 1999, and less than 1 % of the remaining fragments were larger than 100 ha<strong>&#160;</strong>(Andahur 2001). As the area of remaining forest has decreased, the rate of conversion to pasture and plantations has lessened, but selective logging continues to degrade and remove remaining forest (T. Dornas <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Logging mainly targets durable woods that include most of the species's native foodplants, for use as fence poles and for improvements to farms (T. Dornas&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). It is likely that logging reduces the availability of hollow trees for nesting (T. Dornas <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Cement companies are beginning to target areas of limestone outcrops<strong>&#160;</strong>(C. A. Bianchi&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2006). Small areas of forest are flooded as the result of the construction of small hydroelectric power plants (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018). Future hydroelectric plant developments in tributaries such as the Inferno and&#160;SÃÂ£o Domingos rivers could potentially flood thousands of hectares of remaining habitat (T. Dornas, <em>pers. comm</em>., in Dornas and Pinheiro 2018; T. Dornas <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Recently, small scale sugarcane and soybean plantations are replacing old pastures in some areas in the surroundings of Terra Ronca State Park, the only conservation unit with significant size within the speciesÃ¢ÂÂs range (T. Dornas <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020).<br/><br/>The species is rarely recorded in trade or exotic bird collections but this poses a potential threat (Olmos <em>et al</em>. 1997). The species is sometimes shot when foraging in rice and corn fields (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018).<p></p>The species may be at risk from habitat alteration as a result of climate change (Borges <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).","It is locally common within its restricted range (Olmos <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997). <br/><br/>Surveys in 1995 recorded individuals at a density of 198 per km<sup>2</sup> in larger blocks of dry forest (considered likely to be an overestimate due to an uneven distribution of a food plant), 23 per km<sup>2</sup> in isolated fragments of forest, and 60-75 per km<sup>2</sup> across the whole of the Nova Roma area (thought to be a more accurate estimate; Olmos <em>et al. </em>1997). Based on an estimated remaining area of forest in 1995 of c.2,700 km<sup>2</sup> and a population density of 60-75 individuals per km<sup>2</sup>, the population size was estimated at 162,000 - 202,500 individuals, although it was noted that this may have been an overestimate because the area where surveys took place may have contained more remaining habitat than other parts of the species's range (Olmos <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997).<br/><br/>Surveys across the species's range in 2007-2008 estimated the density to be 11.7 (9-15) individuals per km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Bianchi 2010). Based on an estimated area of remaining forest of&#160;4,352 km<sup>2</sup>, the population size was estimated at&#160;39,168Ã¢ÂÂ65,280 individuals (Bianchi 2010).<br/><br/>In 2020, the population was suspected to fall in the range of 20,000 - 25,000 individuals (T. Dornas <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020). According to remote sensing data on tree cover and tree cover loss, there may be approximately 2,000 km<sup>2</sup> of tree cover with at least 50% canopy cover remaining within the species's range in 2021 (Global Forest Watch 2021). Based on the population density estimates from 2007-2008 (9-15 individuals per km<sup>2</sup>), the population size in 2021 is here estimated to fall within the range 18,000 - 30,000 individuals, roughly equating to 12,000 - 20,000 mature individuals, with a best estimate of 16,000.<br/><br/>The subpopulation structure is not known. The species generally stays within 300 m of forest with limestone outcrops (Bianchi 2010), although it has been recorded up to 1.5 km away (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018), so it is able to travel at least short distances between patches of forest.","<em>Pyrrhura pfrimeri</em> is restricted to the narrow dry forest belt in the ParanÃÂ£ river basin, in the foothills to the west of the Serra Geral, in northeast GoiÃÂ¡s and southeast Tocantins (Silva 1995; Olmos <em>et al</em>. 1997; Joseph 2000)<strong></strong>, <strong>Brazil</strong>. It occupies a small range within which much of its forest habitat has been (and continues to be) logged (Olmos <em>et al</em>. 1997). Surveys have not found the species in many of the remaining forest fragments within its range, and in Tocantins there may only be five or six fragments that continue to hold viable populations (T. Dornas <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020).",The species is rarely recorded in trade or exotic bird collections but this poses a potential threat (Olmos&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997).,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>In Brazil, it is legally designated as Endangered at the national level (MMA 2014) and protected under Brazilian law. It occurs within Terra Ronca State Park and Mata Grande National Forest<strong> </strong>(C. A.

It is included in the National Action Plan for the Conservation of the Birds of the Cerrado and Pantanal, which includes actions to create habitat corridors and further protected areas for the species (ICMBio 2014).<br/><br/>The flatlands of Terra Ronca State Park are now mostly deforested, leaving fragments of forest only on karst limestone outcrops (Willis<em> in litt</em>.).

Very few private aviculturists are known to keep the species in captivity<strong> </strong>(C. A. Bianchi <em>in litt</em>. 2006, 2007). A project focussing on this species took place from 2012-2014 (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018).

Its range is declining as a result of ongoing colonisation of range islands by Black Rats, and a small number of further rat introductions or cyclone events could rapidly affect all remaining island populations. For these reasons, the species is listed as Vulnerable.<p></p>","It is typically found in lowland forest, mixed stands of native and cultivated trees, flowering plants, coconut, and banana plantations and gardens, where it feeds on nectar, soft fruit and flowers (Pratt <em>et al.</em> 1987; Collar 1997)<strong></strong>. On Tuamotu, its abundance is related to the association and density of <em>Cocos nucifera</em> and <em>Heliotropium foertherianum</em> (Ziembicki and Raust 2006).&#160;It nests in cavities in dead trees. The species is able to fly between motus and has been observed flying between islands five kilometres apart (Ziembicki and Raust 2006). It may be able to fly between islands when they are close together (J.-C. Thibault <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020).<p></p>","The primary threat to the species is the invasive Black Rat <em>Rattus rattus</em>. The species's extinction from many islands is most likely due to predation by Black Rat, and to a lesser extent, feral cats <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Felis catus</span> (Lovegrove<em> et al</em>. 1989).&#160;Although its range reduction in the Society Islands correlates with the spread of the introduced Swamp Harrier&#160;<em>Circus approximans&#160;</em>(Holyoak and Thibault 1984), surveys across 28 islands in French Polynesia found that, although the introduction of the swamp harrier could have accelerated the declines of&#160;<em>Vini</em>&#160;species, the main threat was the presence of&#160;the Black Rat<em>&#160;</em>(Seitre and Seitre 1992). Surveys of islands across French Polynesia have found that the lorikeet is usually absent, or is present only in very low numbers on islands where&#160;Black Rat&#160;is present (Seitre and Seitre 1992; Ziembick and Raust 2006). The accidental introduction of black rats (<em>Rattus rattus</em>) to the islands where Blue Lorikeet persists is a continuing threat to the species, especially in the Tuamotu archipelago, where all range islands are inhabited and copra exploitation is ongoing on most islands, providing opportunities for rat introductions (C. Blanvillain <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>The species's extinction from Makatea in the Tuamotus could have been accelerated by a particularly violent cyclone (Thibault and Guyot 1987)<strong></strong>. A cyclone in 2010 caused damage to c.75% of trees on Aitutaki (G. McCormack pers. comm 2010, in Jennings 2011) and resulted in the loss of over 50% of the lorikeet population (Jennings 2011), although the long-term impact is not known. Climate change is predicted to cause an increase in the frequency and intensity of storms, potentially affecting the lorikeet.<br/><br/>Habitat loss through conversion to tree plantations, agriculture and urbanisation also presents a threat, as the species relies on dead trees for nesting. Habitat may also be lost through sea level rise as a result of climate change. The species is sometimes trapped for the pet trade.<p></p>","In the Society Islands, there were possibly up to 250 pairs on Motu One and 350-400 pairs on Manuae respectively in 1973 (Thibault 1974). In 2015, the population size on Manuae was found to be stable and the population on Maupiha'a was estimated to be 200-300 individuals (J.-C. Thibault <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;<br/><br/>In Tuamotu, there were 100-200 birds on Rangiroa, and small flocks on several other atolls in 1973 (D. Holyoak pers. comm. 1973). A minimum of 300 individuals were estimated on Tiamanu Motu in Apataki atoll&#160;in 1989 (Lovegrove<em>&#160;et al</em>. 1989)<strong></strong>. On Tikehau, 30 pairs were counted in 1984 (Poulsen <em>et al.</em>&#160;1984), and at least 50 individuals on one motu in 2001 (Serra 2001). Surveys in 2005-2006 estimated populations of 1,258 (+/- 351) on Apataki, 2,546 (+/- 485) on Aruatua, 778 (+/157) on Kaukara, 1,249 (+/-173) on Rangiroa, and 49 (+/24) on Tikehau, resulting in a total population estimate for Tuamotu of 5,879 (+/-643; Ziembicki and Raust 2006). Estimated population densities ranged from 40 individuals per km<sup>2</sup> in the presence of rats to 580 individuals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in favourable habitat on Arutua. In 2016, it was reported that the population on Rangiroa was stable (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), but that the population on&#160;Tikehau was possibly extinct (C. Blanvillain <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020).<br/><br/>The total population size in French Polynesia is estimated to fall within the range 6,500 - 9,400 individuals, which roughly equates to 4,300 - 6,300 mature individuals, with a best estimate of 5,300 mature individuals.<br/><br/>On Aitutaki, where it was probably introduced, numbers have been estimated at several hundred individuals (Wilson 1993)<strong></strong>, 2,400 individuals and 1,000 individuals (Raust and Ziembicki 2006)<strong></strong>. The apparent differences may be attributable to differing census techniques (G. McCormack verbally 1999)<strong></strong>.&#160;In 2009, the island population was estimated at 4,200 individuals (Koutsofta unpub. in Jennings 2011), and following Cyclone Pat in 2010, the island population was estimated at 1,448 birds by distance sampling&#160;(Jennings 2011). The population on Aitutaki is not included in the global population size estimate because Aitutaki is unlikely to be part of the species's native range.<br/><br/>The species is able  to fly between motus and has been observed flying between islands five kilometres apart (Ziembicki and Raust 2006). In French Polynesia, the species is likely to have between seven and nine subpopulations. The largest is thought to be on Arutua, with an estimated population size of&#160;2,546 (+/- 485) individuals, roughly equating to 1,300 - 2,100 mature individuals, which may represent approximately a third of the total French Polynesian population.","<em>Vini peruviana</em> is widely but unevenly distributed in the Society Islands and the Tuamotu Archipelago,&#160;<strong>French Polynesia</strong>. It originally occurred on at least 20 islands, and probably many more, including Tahiti, Moorea, Bora Bora, Maupiti, Raiatea, Tahaa, Huahine, Maupihaa (Mopelia), Motu One (Bellingshausen) and&#160;Manuae (Scilly) in the Society Islands, and Rangiroa, Tikehau, Niau, Makatea, Kaukura, Ahe (Ahii), Takapoto and Takaroa, Arutua and Apataki in the Tuamotus (J.-C. Thibault pers. comm. 1974). It now remains on eight islands or atolls within its native range: Manuae, Motu One and Maupihaa (Mopelia) in the Society Islands, and Kaukura, Rangiroa, Arutua, Apataki and Tikehau in Tuamotu. One individuals was seen on Raiatea in 2003, but this is likely to have been a released or vagrant individual (Ziembicki and Raust 2006). The species also occurs on Aitutaki in the Cook Islands, where it was probably introduced in the early 19th Century by Polynesians.",The species is sometimes trapped for the pet trade.,<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II.

However, forest cover loss on Java this century has been minimal (Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Higginbottom&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, Global Forest Watch 2023), and the only contemporary threat thought to be driving declines in this species is capture for the cagebird trade. There is evidence for increasing demand of this species for the cagebird trade over the past decade, and this is suspected to be driving moderately rapid population declines. Market data show a possible increase in demand from&#160;<em>c</em>.2016/2017, broadly in line with an increase in cagebird ownership on Java over the past decade (cf.

Nonetheless, it is evidently scarce, being observed in only nine (0.4%) of 2,417 surveyed grid squares (although many only partially) during the BigMonth2020 citizen science project (Squires <em>et al</em>. 2021) and having a relatively low average encounter rate of 0.11 (birds/groups per hour) on mountains across Java (Marsden <em>et al</em>. 2023).","<em>Loriculus pusillus</em> is endemic to Java and Bali, <strong>Indonesia</strong>.<p></p>","This species is targeted for the cagebird trade, perhaps in place of other, now much rarer, Indonesian parrots. It is also sometimes used as a training bird for White-rumped Shama <em>Copsychus malabaricus </em>singing competitions (Okarda <em>et al</em>. 2022). The extent to which demand for this species is driving wild population declines is enigmatic. Symes&#160;<em>et al</em>.

The main threat is potential colonisation by Black Rats,&#160;which are currently absent from Rimatara and Atiu. It is therefore assessed as Endangered.<p></p>","On Rimatara, the most favoured habitat is mixed horticultural woodlands, including coconut and <em>Paraserianthes falcataria</em> plantations, and it seems to be less common in native makatea forest (McCormack and KÃÂ¼nzle 1996). However, they may depend on native forest for nesting in <em>Barringtonia asiatica</em> trees (Blanvillain 2002), thus its importance may have been underestimated (C. Blanvillain <em>in litt.</em> 2016).&#160;Highest densities are recorded in plantations and around villages where fruits and flowers are abundant (Thibault and Cibois 2017). It feeds on nectar from a wide variety of flowering plants (nearly all recently introduced) (McCormack and KÃÂ¼nzle 1996, Thibault and Cibois 2017)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.","Excessive exploitation for its red feathers is the most likely reason for the species' extinction from the Cook Islands (Watling 1995,<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&#160;</span><strong></strong>McCormack and KÃÂ¼nzle 1996)<strong></strong>. <br/>Currently, the main threat to the species is potential colonisation by Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus </em>(Seitre and Seitre 1992, Blanvillain and Ghestemme 2015) which are absent from Rimatara and Atiu (Gouni<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2007; Blanvillain <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2015b; Lieberman<em> et al. </em>2018) and are believed to be preventing the species from establishing on Mitiaro (McCormack 2017). The introduction of Black Rats is generally considered the main cause of lorikeet extinction (Thibault and Cibois 2017) and introduction to Rimatara or Atiu would likely cause the rapid decimation of these populations. Polynesian Rats <em>Rattus exulans, </em>Brown Rats <em>Rattus norvegicus </em>and feral cats <em>Felis catus </em>are present, though unlikely to be driving significant declines. The Common Myna&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Acridotheres tristis&#160;</span>was previously a threat to the introduced population on Atiu as it competed for nesting sites and was reported to attack fledglings (Lieberman and McCormack 2008, Malcolm 2008, Heptonstall 2010), though the species was successfully eradicated in 2016 (Lieberman <em>et al.</em> 2018). There has been a confirmed predation event of two nestlings by White-tailed Tropicbird&#160;<em>Phaethon&#160;lepturus&#160;</em>(Tuuhia 2022). <br/>Habitat destruction is a concern; the construction of an airport destroyed over a third of remaining native forest and it was extended in 2015 (Blanvillain&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015a). Since 2012, many large trees on Rimatara have been cleared for agriculture and to allow regeneration of coconut trees (C. Blanvillain <em>in litt. </em>2016). Construction for tourist accommodation and new housing is ongoing (Tuuhia 2022).<p></p>","This species is restricted to Rimatara, its last remaining native island, and Atiu, where it was reintroduced in 2007. The first breeding on Atiu was reported in 2008, with&#160;more than 92 birds in 2011 (R. Malcolm&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2010, 2012). The latest population estimate is 835 individuals on Rimatara&#160;(Blanvillain&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015a), and with a daily average of 0.35 birds/ha detected within 50 m of eight road-transects, the population on Atiu was estimated to number 385 individuals in 2016 (Lieberman <em>et al.</em> 2018). The total population is therefore estimated to number 1,220 individuals, and assuming two thirds are mature, is roughly equivalent to 800 mature individuals. <br/>Some birds have reached Mitiaro from Atiu, though the presence of Black Rats on this island is believed to have prevented the species from establishing there (McCormack 2017). Introduced populations of&#160; &gt;1,000 on Teraina,&#160;50 on Tabuaeran and small numbers on&#160;Kiritimati (Thibault and Cibois 2017) are not included in the assessment since the introductions occurred outside the taxon's natural range and the intent was not to reduce extinction risk. As such, they do not meet the required conditions to be included in the categorisation process <em>sensu </em>IUCN guidelines.","<em>Vini kuhlii</em> is restricted to Rimatara in <strong>French Polynesia</strong>.&#160;Fossil and oral traditions indicate that the species was formerly on at least five of the Southern Cook Islands (Steadman 1989, McCormack and KÃÂ¼nzle 1996)<strong></strong>. In April 2007, twenty-seven birds were re-introduced to Atiu in the <strong>Cook Islands</strong> from Rimatara. Atiu has similar vegetation to Rimatara and is free of Black Rat&#160;<em>Rattus rattus</em>, although Pacific Rat&#160;<em>R. exulans&#160;</em>is abundant.&#160;The species also occurs on Teraina, Tabuaeran and Kiritimati,&#160;Kiribati, where it was introduced by Polynesians, though these introductions lie outside of the natural range and were not intended to reduce extinction risk and therefore do not meet the required conditions to be included in the assessment.","Excessive exploitation for its red feathers is the most likely reason for the species' extinction from the Cook Islands (Watling 1995<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">,&#160;</span><strong></strong>McCormack and KÃÂ¼nzle 1996).","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II.

Biosecurity has been enhanced on Rimatara to prevent colonisation by black rats, including trapping and baiting, quarantine procedures, development of ecotourism activity, raising the awareness of local people and children through the creation of Site Support Groups (Blanvillain <em>et al. </em>2014) and the importation sniffer dogs which are used to detect rats in containers arriving to the island (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em> 2015a). As a result of awareness campaigns on Atiu, the public inspects all off-loaded cargo arriving to the island as well as watching for the tell-tale signs typical of black rat activity on gnawed coconuts (Lieberman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).

In 2006, SerranÃÂ­a del IÃÂ±ao National Park and Sustainable Management Area was designated, providing the foundations for actions to conserve one of the species's largest roosts in Bolivia, which is located nearby<strong> </strong>(Rivera<strong> </strong><em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2009). Conservation action plans have been developed for each of its range countries (L. Rivera <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Monitoring of known roosts is ongoing (L. Rivera and N. Politi <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Binational awareness programmes are carried out, involving the production of booklets, videos, brochures and posters, and the organisation of festivals.<strong><br/><br/>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Produce an accurate estimate of the current population size. Investigate the species's altitudinal migrations and research the genetic structure to identify subpopulations. Carry out research to clarify the extent of threat from trade. Continue surveying known roosts to monitor the population trend.<br/>Increase the percentage of breeding habitat in Argentina that is receiving protection (Pidgeon <em>et al.</em> 2015). Tackle unsustainable resource use and illegal activities in protected areas. Consider reforesting key nesting and feeding trees. Supplement nest sites using boxes where appropriate (A. B. Hennessey <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Enforce bans on poaching and on local trade, particularly in Bolivia (L.

Nevertheless, despite the current recovery, the population is projected to decline rapidly in the future as a consequence of habitat loss, trapping and diseases. The species is therefore listed as Vulnerable.<br/><p></p>","It breeds in open savanna woodland and riverine forest below 1,000&#160;m, with tree-hollow nests recorded in over 30 tree species (Prestes<em> et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1997). Breeding occurs in late September-January, with young generally fledging by late December. The density of nests is 3.3 per km<sup>2</sup> (Martinez 2004). The species is closely associated with <em>Araucaria angustifolia</em>, particularly during the non-breeding season, but it also roosts in <em>Acacia</em>, <em>Pinus </em>and <em>Eucalyptus </em>plantations.<br/>The diet includes seeds of <em>A. angustifolia</em> (which are especially important between April and August) and <em>Podocarpus lamberti</em> (important between January and February in some areas), but also fruit, seeds leaves or flowers of 72 tree species (N. P. Prestes and J. Martinez <em>in litt</em>. 2020). <br/>Radiotelemetry studies found that during the breeding period the species moves on average 14 km per day over an area of c.400 ha, while during the non-breeding period movements average to 37 km per day over an area of 48,000 ha (Martinez 2004).<br/><p></p>","The most severe threat to this species currently is the degradation of forested habitat through grazing and trampling by cattle, which is hindering the regeneration of trees important for nesting and feeding (N. P. Prestes and J. Martinez <em>in litt</em>. 2020, Vannucchi <em>et al</em>. 2022). Forest destruction reached highest levels between the 1910s and 1940s (ICMBio 2018, Fernandes <em>et al</em>. 2019).  In 1914, 25% of Rio Grande do Sul was forested; by 1988 this area had shrunk to 3% as a result of logging for timber and fuelwood, intense grazing and livestock trampling, as well as over-exploitation of non-timber forest products, notably <em>Araucaria</em> seeds, which possibly explains the range shift to Santa Catarina<strong> </strong>(Snyder <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2000). Currently, tree cover is lost at a rate of up to 10% over three generations (31.2 years; Global Forest Watch 2021, using Hansen <em>et al</em>. [2013] data and methods disclosed therein). A planned wind farm in Santa Catarina may pose a threat to the species during migration (Fernandes <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/>There is an organised internal trade, with parrots usually taken by cutting the nesting-tree, resulting in permanent abandonment. The illegal pet trade has however reduced in recent years as a result of environmental education and awareness campaigns in local communities (N. P. Prestes and J. Martinez <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Despite a reduction in pressure, poaching and illegal trade are still ongoing locally (Fernandes <em>et al</em>. 2019). Nest monitoring revealed that over ten  years about one-quarter of nests were poached (Vannucchi <em>et al</em>. 2022). A further potential threat is the outbreak of diseases including Avian Bornavirus and Psittacine Circoviral Disease, which are currently present in captive populations of parrots in Brazil and may reach wild populations in the near future (Vannucchi <em>et al</em>. 2022).<br/><br/><p></p>","The population is estimated at 22,300 individuals, of which 15,600 are thought to be mature individuals (Vannucchi <em>et al</em>. 2022).<br/><p></p>","<em>Amazona pretrei</em> breeds in Rio Grande do Sul, south <strong>Brazil</strong>, with main populations in the Campo de Cima da Serra, Planalto MÃÂ©dio, DepressÃÂ£o Central, Serra do Sudeste and Alto Uruguai (Prestes<em> et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1997). The species migrates north in the austral winter; most of the wintering population formerly roosted at Aracuri but, since 1991, there has been a shift to south-east Santa Catarina<strong> </strong>(Snyder <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2000). In 1994, there were 15 roost sites in use seasonally, but large roosts at Aracuri and RincÃÂ£o dos Pereira had disappeared.<br/> Wandering birds may occur in <strong>Argentina</strong> and <strong>Paraguay</strong>,<strong> </strong>but there are only three recent records<strong></strong> (Brooks <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1993, Lowen <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996, Chebez <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1998<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><strong></strong>) and despite comprehensive surveys in Argentina the species could not be confirmed since 1991 (N. Prestes and J. Martinez<em> in litt</em>. 2020).<br/><p></p>","The species is targeted for the illegal pet trade at domestic level, as chicks are poached from nests. During the 1990s, between 300 and 500 chicks were poached annually near Lagoa Vermelha (Prestes <em>et al</em>. 1997) and transported to markets in Porto Alegre, Caxias do Sul, Santa Maria, Florianopolis and other southern cities in Brazil (Fernandes <em>et al</em>. 2019). Trapping pressure has greatly reduced as a consequence of awareness and environmental education campaigns in rural communities across the range (N. P. Prestes and J. Martinez <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Trapping is nevertheless still ongoing, and nest monitoring revealed that over ten years about one-quarter of nests were poached (Vannucchi <em>et al</em>. 2022).","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I and II.

Population monitoring has been carried out since 1991 by Projeto Char<span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en"">ÃÂ£o. There are breeding populations in five reserves and two austral winter feeding sites are protected (Wege and Long 1995). In 2018, the private reserve RPPN Papagaios-de-Altitude was created in Urupema, Santa Catarina, with support from IUCN NL and Rainforest Trust (N. P. Prestes and J. Martinez <em>in litt</em>. 2020).

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size has not been quantified, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","This species inhabits extensive tracts of lowland tropical evergreen forest, also occurring in palm stands, deciduous and gallery woodland and secondary growth near forest (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997). It feeds on a variety of fruit and seeds, also taking buds, flowers and nectar. Breeding in south-central Brazil has been noted in November-February (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997).","The primary threat to this species is accelerating deforestation in the   Amazon Basin, as land is cleared for cattle ranching and soy production,  facilitated by expansion of the road network (Soares-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2006, Bird <em>et al.</em> 2011). Currently, large parts of the range are still pristine, e.g. in Suriname (O. Ottema <em>in litt</em>. 2020). However, the subpopulation in the Atlantic Forest in Brazil may be more severely affected by habitat loss, as deforestation in this part of the range is higher than in other areas, proceeding at a rate equivalent to 21% over three generations (Fernandes <em>et al</em>. 2019, Global Forest Watch 2021, using Hansen <em>et al</em>. [2013] data and methods disclosed therein). Changes to the Brazilian Forest Code reduced the  percentage of land a private landowner is legally required to maintain  as forest (including, critically, a reduction in the width of forest  buffers alongside perennial steams) and include an amnesty for  landowners who deforested before July 2008 (Bird <em>et al. </em>2011).  This new environmental policy is seemingly incentivising farmers to clear more land, and deforestation rates and wildfire intensity in the Brazilian Amazon have increased drastically since 2018 (S. Dantas <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species is heavily hunted for food in French Guiana and persecuted as a crop pest in Ecuador (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020, D. F. Cisneros-Heredia <em>in litt</em>. 2022). Trapping pressure  for domestic and international trade is assumed to be much more widespread, with trade levels in  this species described as generally moderate, but heavy in some  countries and increasing in recent years (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997, S. Bruslund <em>in litt</em>. 2022, D. F. Cisneros-Heredia <em>in litt</em>. 2022).","The population size has not been quantified. The species can be locally common in parts of its range, both in primary and mature secondary forest (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020, O. Ottema <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The geographically disjunct population in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest  was found to be genetically distinct from that in the greater Amazon  Basin (Hellmich <em>et al</em>. 2021); therefore the species forms at least two separate subpopulations.","<em>Amazona farinosa</em> is widespread from eastern <strong>Panama</strong>, south and east through <strong>Colombia</strong>, <strong>Venezuela</strong>, <strong>Guyana</strong>, <strong>Suriname</strong>, <strong>French Guiana</strong>, <strong>Ecuador</strong>, <strong>Peru</strong>, <strong>Bolivia</strong> and <strong>Brazil</strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997). Large populations are said to persist in the less disturbed parts of its range.<br/><p></p>","The species is trapped for the cagebird trade, albeit at a generally moderate or even low rate; trapping pressure can however be locally higher (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Ecuador, the trapping intensity appears to be increasing in recent years (D. F. Cisneros-Heredia <em>in litt</em>. 2022). International trade is mainly focused on Asia, where the species is imported in substantial numbers (S. Bruslund <em>in litt</em>. 2022). In Guyana, the export quota has recently been reduced to 300 individuals per year (S. Bruslund <em>in litt</em>. 2022). Moreover, the species is heavily hunted for food in French Guiana and persecuted as a crop pest in Ecuador (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020, D. F.

Halaouate&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2012). Hence the population size was estimated to fall in the wider band of 2,500-9,999 mature individuals. With reports of a recent notable reduction in abundance a re-estimation of the density and population size is required, but in the absence of a new estimate the existing value is retained.","<em>T. rosenbergii</em> is endemic to the twin islands of Biak-Supiori, <strong>Indonesia</strong>. It has apparently become uncommon within the past decade (Bergmark 2019, Bocos 2019), with the last stronghold the remaining forests of Supiori (M. Halaouate <em>in litt. </em>2013). The area of forest, as derived from the 'GlobCover 2' land classification GIS layer (Arino&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012), is estimated at 1,572 km<sup>2</sup>, after the exclusion of fragments smaller than 1 km<sup>2</sup>.&#160;If all of this was occupied by the species would result in a maximum area of occupancy (AOO) of 2,780 km<sup>2</sup>. Given the recent reports of the species becoming much more difficult to observe, the true area now occupied is suspected to be smaller than this, but is uncertain as the species is thought to travel widely across the island in search of flowering trees (Mayr and Meyer de&#160;Schauensee 1939).",Introduced into aviculture in 1988 but remains rare (Low 2016).

The species has been heavily targeted for the illegal bird trade on Biak, but remains commoner elsewhere in the small range. Rapid rates of reduction in abundance on Biak reported between 1982 and 1997 appeared to have slowed in the 2000s (after importation to the EU was banned and controls on exports tightened) and encounter rates appear similar for visits over the past decade. However, high rates of trapping have been noted on Biak again recently, leading to the inference that there is an ongoing reduction in the number of mature individuals, potentially compounded by current (albeit relatively low) rates of forest cover loss. While trapping poses a threat that may apply across the population, the number of locations only approaches the threshold for listing as threatened. As such, it is assessed as Near Threatened.<p></p>","It is a gregarious species which apparently feeds chiefly in inland forest, up to 460&#160;m (although becoming less common at altitudes above 200&#160;m on Supiori, at least), and roosts in coconut plantations and nearby coastal forest (Bishop 1982)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Mayr and Meyer de Schauensee (1939) describe it as being less abundant in intact inland forest and more frequent in secondary habitats. It is common in ""flat forest"" on Supiori (Gibbs 1993)&#160;but is absent from low scrubby regrowth (K. D. Bishop <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>","Relatively large numbers were previously trapped for the domestic and international trade (Nash 1990, K. D. Bishop <em>in litt</em>. 1994)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and this species was commonly observed as a pet on Biak (Bishop 1982)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Recently trapping pressure has been reported to be high and causing further declines on Biak (Bergmark 2019, M. Halaouate <em>in litt. </em>2022), noting that numbers were previously reduced here (K. D. Bishop <em>in&#160; litt. </em>2000).&#160;<br/><br/>Forest on Biak has come under heavy pressure from logging and subsistence farming, though large-scale logging has not been economically feasible for some time (Wikramanayake&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002). The rate of forest cover loss recorded through satellite monitoring has been slow in the past two decades, and over the past three generations of the species the maximum rate is estimated at 3.6% (data from Global Forest Watch 2021, using Hansen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;[2013] data and methods disclosed therein). The species is tolerant of degraded forest but does require forest cover, hence it is unclear that this low rate of forest cover loss will be driving a significant population reduction. Much of Supiori comprises virtually impenetrable, forested limestone mountains, which is likely to be safe from habitat degradation.<br/><br/>Large areas of forest on Biak have previously been destroyed or damaged by logging and subsistence farming, particularly the southern plains (Bishop 1982, K.D. Bishop <em>in litt</em>. 1996, D. Holmes <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Forest regeneration is slow on areas of raised coralline limestone, which comprises most of Biak. There is also a proposal for a spaceport on the eastern side of Biak, which would cause the loss of 6.5km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of Protection Forest (Perwitasari and Susanti 2019) and may result in further development (e.g. expanded and improved road infrastructure and increased settlement in the area).<p></p>","The species is generally common on the island of Biak (Beehler and Pratt 2016), despite reports of abundance having declined between 1982 and 1995 (K. D. Bishop <em>in litt. </em>2000). There are no published estimates of population or density for Black-winged Lory. The plausible range of population can be inferred from the densities of congeners and the area of forest habitat within the range of the species. Other species in the genus&#160;<em>Eos&#160;</em>have been studied on a number of islands with an average abundance of 47 individuals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(from 28 reported density estimates: Santini&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). The area of forest within the range (Biak and surrounding small islands, Numfor Manim and Num)&#160;totals 1,756 km<sup>2</sup> (extracted from the GlobCover 2 land cover layer [Arino <em>et al. </em>2012]).&#160; If half of the area were to be occupied at the average density reported for <em>Eos </em>lories, the population would be 41,317 individuals, with the 25-75 percentile range of densities giving a range of 11,743-67,386 individuals. This indicative population size suggests that the species is likely to exceed the threshold for listing as threatened under the small and declining population size criterion.<br/><br/>While individuals and groups move extensively in the search for fruiting and flowering trees, these movements are similar to those undertaken by other members of the genus, and are of small scale hence are not considered to represent genuine nomadic movements. As such, while the species is obviously capable of crossing stretches of sea to reach other islands, it is plausible that there are up to four subpopulations, and two is the most likely number (Numfor and Biak/Supiori with the minor islands).","<em>Eos cyanogenia</em> is endemic to the Geelvink Islands of Papua (formerly Irian Jaya), <strong>Indonesia</strong>, where it is known from the islands of Biak-Supiori, and the much smaller islands of Numfor, Manim and Mios Num (Mayr and Meyer de Schauensee 1939, Beehler <em>et al</em>. 1986, Beehler and Pratt 2016, Collar and Boesman 2020)<strong></strong>. There are additional records on the very small Owi and Wundi islands (eBird 2021), suggesting that it may be present on many of the satellite islands southeast of Biak. On Biak, it is fairly common to common in patchy forest, and is sometimes recorded in flocks of 40-60 (Gibbs 1993, Collar <em>et al</em>. 1994,&#160;eBird 2021). On Supiori, it is common, although less so at higher altitudes (Bishop 1982, Gibbs 1993): it appears commoner in plantations and degraded forest rather than primary forest inland (Mayr and Meyer&#160;de Schauensee 1939). It is nomadic, making it difficult to assess its true numbers but, on Biak, it has been reported that it declined notably between 1982 and 1995 (K. D. Bishop <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","Numbers on Biak were noted to have been reduced due to trapping for the pet bird trade between 1982 and 1995 (K. D.

Favoured feed trees tend to occur on lower slopes (Biggs <em>et al</em>. 2011) and riparian areas (Rycken 2019). They use their long upper mandible to extract marri nut seeds without crushing the fruit (Cooper <em>et al</em>. 2002) as well as taking seeds of jarrah, proteaceous shrubs including Banksia spp., cultivated apples and pears, and insect larvae (Halse 1986, Johnstone and Kirkby 2008, Johnstone <em>et al</em>. 2010).

Fire, both wildfire and controlled burns, destroys nest trees, may promote disease of nest and feeding trees and can reduce the availability of food from mature marri (Mastrantonis <em>et al.</em> 2019), a threat likely to intensify if the probability of fire continues to increase (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2016). Plant diseases are also affecting food and nest trees (Johnstone and Kirkby 2019), an effect exacerbated by drought and heat waves (Matusick <em>et al</em>. 2018). Although the species has been fully protected since 1996 (Mawson and Johnstone 1997), illegal shooting by orchardists may still occur where they feed on apples and pears (Chapman 2007).

They also occupy more lightly timbered habitats, including farmland and urban areas, especially during winter when part of the upland population moves to lower elevations (Chambers 1995), also extending into regrowth forests and drier forest types such as box-ironbark (Loyn 1985). Gang-gangs nest in relatively large hollows, with nest height reflecting the structural characteristics of the vegetation (Chambers 1995, Davey <em>et al.</em> 2019). Observations in NSW and the ACT suggest that nests appear to be clustered (NSW Scientific Committee 2008,; M. Mulvaney <em>pers. comm</em>.). Gang-gang Cockatoos typically lay two eggs (Higgins 1999), though nests containing three young have been recorded (Davey <em>et al.</em> 2019). Their principal native foods are the seeds of eucalypts and acacias, along with other native shrubs (e.g.<em> Persoonia</em> spp.) and insects such as gall insects (Higgins 1999). Exotic foods, such as hawthorn <em>Crataegus monogyna,</em> may be an important part of the diet for some populations, as can suburban plantings of out-of-range eucalypts (Davey and Eales 2016).</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-AU"">Gang-gang Cockatoos are among the least studied species in the family in Australia, and there is inadequate understanding of the reasons they have been declining (Cameron 2007). Plausible threats include the loss of habitat through land clearing, particularly along the slopes of the Great Dividing Range, and a reduction in nest hollow availability due to forest management practices (NSW OEH 2020). For urban populations, clearing for housing can lead to the destruction of nest sites. Gang-gang Cockatoos breed mainly in mature forest (Loyn 1985) and decline with increasing removal of old trees (Loyn and Kennedy 2009). Fire poses a threat, destroying nest trees and suppressing seed production in key feed species (Koch 2003). Higher temperatures may also be having an effect (Herold <em>et al.</em> 2018), with heat waves implicated in the premature fledging of nestling Gang-gang Cockatoos (Cameron <em>et al</em>. 2021). <a name=""_Hlk63515081"">Extreme fire weather (Di Virgilio <em>et al. </em>2019, Dowdy <em>et al</em>. 2019) driven by longer and more severe droughts (Evans<em> et al.</em> 2017) and more frequent heat waves (Herold<em> et al.</em> 2018) are likely to increase in frequency and intensity in coming decades. </a>Given the broad-scale reduction in older-aged montane forests (Lindenmayer <em>et al.</em> 2015), and the time required for trees to form large hollows, it is plausible that hollow availability has declined across the range, probably leading to increased competition for hollows from other hollow-dependent birds, mammals and maybe European honey bees<em> Apis melifera</em> (Davey <em>et al.</em> 2019, M. Cameron unpublished, in Cameron <em>et al</em>. 2021). However, most threats are speculative.</p>","The estimate used here is the product of three predicted AOO measures (spanning 22,700-40,000 km<sup>2</sup>) from Cameron <em>et al. </em>(2021), the smallest being the number of 2x2 km squares for which there are records since 1990, the latter being an arbitrary value of nearly double this to account for incomplete survey effort of potentially suitable habitat. The density applied assumes an average density of 3.1 birds/km<sup>2</sup>, that the 2019Ã¢ÂÂ2020 fire season reduced the carrying capacity of 40% of grid cells by half and resulted in 10% mortality (Cameron <em>et al</em>. 2021).

There is not believed to be a significant threat to the species of trapping, due to the difficulty in keeping the species alive in captivity. Rates of forest cover loss have been relatively low over the recent past and the species' ability to tolerate degraded habitat casts doubt on there being a significant ongoing decline and indicates that it does not occur in few locations. It is therefore assessed as Least Concern.<p></p>","It occurs in forest, secondary forest and forest gardens, apparently below 150 m though the species may occur up to 400 m. While Mayr and Meyer de Schauensee (1939) indicated that it was found in 'original' forest, and occasionally in remnant large trees in secondary forest, there are many observations from small-scale agricultural gardens with trees, as well as forest on Biak and Numfor (Beehler and Pratt 2016, eBird 2021). It appears that the species is able to tolerate degraded forest habitat relatively well.<p></p>","Forest on Biak has previously been badly impacted by logging and subsistence farming, particularly the southern plains (Bishop 1982, K.D. Bishop&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 1996, D. Holmes&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2000), though large-scale logging has not been economically feasible for some time (Wikramanayake&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002). The rate of forest cover loss recorded through satellite monitoring has been relatively slow in the past two decades, and over the past ten years the maximum rate is estimated at 3.8% (data from Global Forest Watch 2021, using Hansen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;[2013] data and methods disclosed therein). The species is tolerant of degraded forest and appears to persist within landscapes with a large proportion of small-scale agricultural gardens, hence the population impact of the past conversion of forest on Biak and Numfor is suspected to have been less than for a more specialised forest species. Much of Supiori comprises virtually impenetrable, forested limestone mountains, which is likely to be safe from habitat degradation.<br/>There is also a proposal for a spaceport on the eastern side of Biak, which would cause the loss of 6.5 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of Protection Forest (Perwitasari and Susanti 2019) and may result in further development (e.g. expanded and improved road infrastructure and increased settlement in the area): again, the impact on this species is unlikely to be as severe as for species more closely tied to intact forest.<br/>All&#160;<em>Micropsitta&#160;</em>are&#160;very difficult to keep alive in captivity and no member of the genus appears to have been successfully bred. It is accordingly&#160;less frequently targeted for capture for the bird trade than co-occurring parrots such as&#160;<em>Eos cyanogenia&#160;</em>or&#160;<em>Trichoglossus rosenbergi</em>,&#160;and this is not considered a significant threat for the species at present.<p></p>","The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is described as well distributed in good numbers in lowland primary and secondary forests (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1997, Collar and Boesman 2020). There has been no noticeable population decline in the past twenty years (M. Halaouate <em>in litt. </em>2022).","<em>Micropsitta geelvinkiana</em> is endemic to the twin islands of Biak-Supiori and Numfor off Papua, <strong>Indonesia </strong>(Mayr and Meyer de Schauensee 1939, <strong></strong>Bishop 1982, Beehler <em>et al</em>. 1986, Beehler and Pratt 2016, Collar and Boesman 2020, eBird 2021). It is restricted to the lowlands with all records apparently below 150 m (Collar and Boesman 2020), but within this elevation it is found throughout the three main islands and in good numbers on Biak-Supiori at least (Collar and Boesman 2020). Other authors report that it occurs in small numbers (Gibbs 1993, Poulsen and Frolander 1994, Eastwood 1996, B. Beehler and S. van Balen&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2000, M. Van Beirs&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2000). Mayr and Meyer de Schauensee (1939) report the species as being found in original forest and being shy and wary, once or twice flocks of 4-5 were noted in large remnant trees in secondary forest. The large reduction in 'original forest' in lowland Biak is suspected to have reduced the overall population size, however recent rates of forest cover loss have been slow and observations from secondary forest indicates that it not likely to be suffering a continuing decline: recent birdwatching tourist trips to Biak have located the species relatively easily (e.g. Bergmark 2019, Bocos 2020).<br/>The Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated at 7,600 km<sup>2</sup> from a minimum convex polygon around known and probable occurrence polygons (based on Bishop 1982, Beehler and Pratt 2016, eBird 2021).&#160;Given that the species is not thought to be targeted for the bird trade (due to the difficulty of keeping <em>Micropsitta </em>alive in captivity), the major threat is habitat conversion. With two significant protected areas unaffected by this threat, the number of locations cannot be assessed for the species.","<em>Micropsitta </em>are reported to be extremely difficult to keep alive in captivity, hence trade in any species appears to be minimal.

While most clearing of lowland rainforest occurred over a century ago (TSSC 2016), it is thought to have created a temporal gap in food availability during the year (Coxen's Fig-Parrot Recovery Team 2001), particularly during drought when figs produce less fruit (Spencer <em>et al. </em>1996). Various land management practices, including grazing, prevent recruitment of isolated fig trees in paddocks and otherwise cleared land (Coxen's Fig-Parrot Recovery Team 2001).&#160;The lack of connections between habitat patches may provide a barrier to dispersal; the small population size and the fragmented state of the population and its habitat may make it difficult for birds to find sufficient food, particularly during winter; the lack of habitat may have increased the amount of competition between the fig-parrot and other species of birds; and the small population size (or, more specifically, the lack of social interaction) could inhibit birds from breeding (Coxen's Fig-Parrot Recovery Team 2001, Department of the Environment 2014). A predicted increase in the frequency or length of droughts (Evans <em>et al.</em> 2017) could affect food resources. Food supplies are also being reduced by cat's claw creeper <em>Dolichandra unguis-cati</em>, which smothers trees in riparian corridors (TSSC 2016).

The threats causing this are still ongoing and is therefore suspected to decline by the same rate in the future. For this reason the species is evaluated as Vulnerable.,"<p><em>C. l. lathami </em>have an extremely restricted diet, eating only the seeds of a few species of <em>Allocasuarina<a name=""_Hlk59225871""> </a></em>and, less often, <em>Casuarina</em>, favouring one or two species in any one region<em> </em>(Chapman 2007)<em>. </em>They require large hollow-bearing trees for nesting, favouring areas with high densities of such trees (Higgins 1999, Cameron 2006b). While their strong bill gives them access to this nutritious, abundant and relatively stable food resource, intake rates are limited by handling time and cannot be accelerated if the food supply is short (Cameron 2005). The cockatoos lay a single egg in hollows in large old trees, particularly favouring dead trees (Cameron 2006b).&#160;<em>C. l. halmaturinus</em> feed almost exclusively on the seeds of drooping sheoak, preferring trees in which a high proportion of seeds contain kernels (Pepper <em>et al</em>. 2000, Crowley and Garnett 2001). Seed availability appears to be substantially lower after drought (Chapman 2005), in sheoaks more than 60 years old (Delzoppo 2018) and in trees &lt;10 years old (Mooney and Pedler 2005) but planted sheoaks appear capable of producing seed more quickly than trees regenerating naturally (Cameron <em>et al</em>. 2021). When breeding, females lay a single egg in hollows in tall trees, particularly sugar gum <em>Eucalyptus cladocalyx</em> which are thought to take over 100 years to develop suitable nest hollows (Mooney and Pedler 2005) although many pairs now use artificial nest boxes (Berris 2016). Breeding birds return to the same nest site each year.</p><p><br/></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-AU"">Historically, clearance of habitat has reduced the range of <em>C. l. lathami</em>, particularly south and west of the Great Dividing Range and much of their core habitat of the forests in the Great Dividing Range has been affected by fire. These threats also are likely to have caused the extirpation of&#160;<em>C. l. halmaturinus&#160;</em>from the mainland (Joseph 1982).&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">While relatively few birds are likely to have been killed by the 2019Ã¢ÂÂ2020 fires, their food supply, already likely to have been diminished by drought (Cameron 2005, 2006b, 2009), will have depleted in burnt areas for at least a decade. Also, many nest hollows are sure to have been destroyed (Cameron 2009), especially in areas where the exceptionally dry conditions meant the largest trees in low parts of the landscape were destroyed. Any shortage of nesting hollows will increase competition from, for example, brushtail possums <em>Trichosurus </em>spp., which are responsible for high rates of nest failure of C<em>.&#160;l.&#160;halmaturinus</em> on Kangaroo Island (Garnett <em>et al</em>. 1999). The species also suffers from competition with introduced European honeybees <em>Apis mellifera </em>(Cameron <em>et al.</em> 2021). The regeneration of both allocasuarinas and potential future nest trees is impeded by grazing, either by stock or feral or native herbivores like rabbits <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>, goats <em>Capra hircus</em>, and deer (NSW TSSC 2004, Cameron 2005). Furthermore, any loss of suitable nesting hollows may take many decades to replace. In coastal areas, residential development increasingly impinges on cockatoo habitat, although some birds acclimatise and feed in remnant trees. Although Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease has not been detected in wild Glossy Black-Cockatoos, the risk of spread from other cockatoo species, particularly those that compete for nests, is high (Sarker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Climate change in the form of increasingly intense heat waves (Herold <em>et al.</em> 2018), drought (Evans<em> et al.</em> 2017) and extreme fire weather (Di Virgilo <em>et al.</em> 2019, Dowdy <em>et al.</em> 2019), which all act synergistically, is also likely to affect the species within the next three generations.</span></p><p></p>","Using density and occupancy estimates, the population sizes of <em>C. l. lathami </em>and <em>C. l. halmaturinus </em>have been estimated at 6,000-10,500 (best estimate 7,500) and 230-290 (best estimate 250) mature individuals respectively.

For these reasons the species is assessed as Critically Endangered.","<p>In an attempt to explain widespread but scattered records, the species was previously thought to be nomadic or to have very large home ranges (Higgins 1999). However, limited radio- and GPS-tracking carried out by Murphy <em>et al</em>. (2017b) implies that the species is more sedentary than these speculations suggest. Movement of two tracked birds remained within an area of approximately 70 km<sup>2</sup>. Individuals moved approximately 30 km per night within a radius of less than 10 km from roosting locations. Tracked birds moved from their roosts in <em>Triodia</em>&#160;(spinifex) hummocks to feeding sites in more diverse habitats marked by large-seeded grass and forb species. Physiological modelling suggests that the species may need to visit standing water, especially during summer (Kearney <em>et al. </em>2016). The bird GPS-tracked by Murphy&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2017b) only visited a permanent water source once. However, a considerable amount of rain fell during the tracking period, and so ephemeral water sources were likely to be available. During winter, Night Parrots may satisfy water requirements from their diet, which may include succulent plants, such as <em>Sclerolaena </em>spp. (Kearney&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Night Parrots occur in open semi-arid grasslands where roosting habitat is close to feeding grounds that support key seedÃ¢ÂÂproducing species (Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2017b). Most recent studies have located them in or near mature spinifex grassland <em>Triodia</em> spp. where they roost during the day and also breed. <a name=""_Hlk68126156"">They also occur in chenopod-dominated systems in and around salt lakes (Andrews 1883, Leseberg <em>et al</em>. 2021a).</a>&#160;At night radio- and GPS-tracked birds in Queensland flew up to 9&#160;km from their <em>Triodia</em> roost sites to feed and drink (Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2017b). The Queensland birds are known to feed on ephemeral grasslands, consuming a variety of grasses, herbs and chenopods (Murphy <em>et al.</em> 2017b; S. A. Murphy and N. P. Leseberg unpublished in Leseberg <em>et al</em>. 2021b). Breeding occurs at any time of year at the south-western Queensland site if sufficient resources are available, which typically occurs in response to local rain or flooding and may continue for some time. The nest is a flimsy grass cup built on the ground within a spinifex clump or under a chenopod bush. The clutch size is 2<span lang=""EN-AU"">Ã¢ÂÂ<span lang=""EN-AU"">4, and productivity is about 0.8&#160;fledglings per nesting attempt (Murphy <em>et al.</em> 2017a, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2017, N. P. Leseberg unpublished, in Leseberg <em>et al</em>. 2021b). Causes of nest failure include predation by a King Brown Snake <em>Pseudechis australis</em>, and potentially heat stress (Murphy <em>et al.</em> 2017a). Cats <em>Felis catus</em>, which may be attracted to the begging calls of dependent fledglings, almost certainly prey upon young birds, resulting in limited recruitment to the population (Leseberg <em>et al</em>. 2021a).</span></p>  <p></p>","Blyth (1996) proposed a list of threats considered realistic in the absence of direct evidence. Threats to the species are likely to vary across its range and might include predation by feral cats and foxes; soil disturbance, erosion and loss caused by herbivores (including livestock and over-abundant native and feral herbivores);&#160;degradation of habitat around water points by herbivores; competition for food by herbivores; fire;&#160;psittacine beak and feather disease, avian pox, and other diseases;&#160;illegal collection of birds or eggs;&#160;disturbance from bird-watching activities; fences; and reduction in water availability through over-use of waterholes by camels and&#160;reduced waterhole maintenance (TSSC 2016).&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">The sharp decline in reporting of Night Parrots after the 1880s is thought to have been caused primarily by a proliferation of cats (Ashby 1924, Whitlock 1924) but they are among the 20 Australian bird species most likely to be taken by foxes <em>Vulpes vulpes </em>(Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2021). However, fire and grazing are also likely to have been influential in their decline (Blyth 1996, Olsen 2018). The species has persisted where predation pressure from cats and possibly foxes <em>Vulpes vulpes</em> is thought to be low, spinifex cover is stable because appropriate fire regimes are maintained, and there are relatively productive patches in the landscape that have only had moderate grazing pressure from sheep, cattle and rabbits <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> (Murphy <em>et al.</em> 2018). Although well adapted to arid conditions, longer and hotter droughts could have a deleterious effect.&#160;Biophysical modelling suggests that predicted temperature increases under various climate change scenarios would increase the species' dependence on free-standing water dramatically (Kearney&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Thus, climate change, interacting with the spatial configuration of water points and habitats, and the concentration of feral predators at water points, may become a serious future threat.&#160;Concern that detection of the species on pastoral properties would have deleterious effects on subsequent management were generally misplaced (Garnett <em>et al</em>. 2016). <a name=""_Hlk68126184"">Improperly managed potash mining of salt lakes could reduce their suitability by affecting hydrology, fire or predation pressure.</a>","Targeted acoustic surveys across the country since 2013 have detected no more than 30 individual Night Parrots, although comprehensively surveying the large areas of potential habitat where the bird might occur is difficult. Research suggests that wherever the species is found, more individuals occur than are detected, but not many more. The failure to find many additional sites, despite searching, suggests that it is prudent to assume there may be no more. Expert consultation regarding densities known at available habitat indicates a population estimate of 40-500 individuals with a best estimate of 200 (Leseberg <em>et al</em>. 2021b). In any given subpopulation, there is thought not to be any more than 30 individuals (and more likely 20) (Leseberg <em>et al</em>. 2021b).<p></p>","<p>This nocturnal parrot is endemic to <strong>Australia</strong>.

Historically, they were recorded from throughout arid and semi-arid Australia, mostly before the 1880s (Higgins 1999) and the species is now considered extinct in New South Wales and Victoria. Many recent searches using automated recording units, the most suitable technique for detecting the species, have failed to find any birds (N. P. Leseberg, A. H.

They feed primarily on grasses supplemented with legumes and other seeds depending on availability and nutritional needs when breeding. After breeding they aggregate in small flocks which persist until the start of the wet season when they congregate near nesting Black-faced Woodswallows <em>Artamus cinerea</em>, which alert the parrots to the presence of predators at a time when food is scarce, and they have less time to be vigilant (Golden-shouldered Parrot Recovery Team 2019)<em>.&#160;</em>Through the wet season the species switches foods continually, feeding through most of the daylight hours. It nests late in the wet season and lays an average of six eggs, which hatch early in the dry season when seeds are abundant (Levy 2004). The species is potentially limited by the availability of nest sites, as they rarely re-use the same mound once the termites have repaired the damage with tougher material, and new termite mounds are very slow to build up (Levy 2004).","<p><span lang=""EN-AU"">The primary reason for the decline of the species has been because Indigenous traditional owners have been unable to fulfil their cultural obligations to Country. Traditional management has until recently largely been displaced by the grazing of cattle, often at densities that have led to a loss of the grasses the parrots require in the wet season and which provide fuel for fires that maintain an open structure in the woodlands. The altered vegetation structure would appear to have favoured parrot predators like Pied Butcherbirds <em>Cracticus nigrogularis</em> and disadvantaged woodswallows that serve as sentinels.&#160;Predation of adults is a major cause of nest failure, with almost one third of nests losing one or more adults. These effects have been compounded by the active removal of dingoes <em>Canis dingo</em>, a culturally important species, potentially leading to increases in the density of smaller predators, including cats <em>Felis catus</em> and perhaps goannas <em>Varanus</em> spp., as well as agile wallabies <em>Macropus agilis</em> and introduced pigs <em>Sus scrofa</em>, which destroy both wet season foods and knock over large termite mounds. Eventually, both termite mounds and parrots disappear from the landscape (Golden-shouldered Parrot Recovery Team 2019).</p>","Currently, about 629Ã¢ÂÂ933 Golden-shouldered Parrots occur in the Morehead River area, and 148Ã¢ÂÂ168 occur in the Staaten River area (Golden-shouldered Parrot Recovery Team unpublished, in Golden-shouldered Parrot Recovery Team 2021).","<em></em><em>Psephotellus&#160;</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">chrysopterygius</span> is endemic to southern and central Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Australia</span>.

Although these breeding areas are separated by about 200 km, dispersal between them is considered likely given the number of what are now thought to be dispersing birds in the coastal lowlands west of the Great Dividing Range, as area unsuitable for breeding because it floods so regularly (Crowley and Preece 2019). These include the earliest records from east of Normanton, 200 km south-west of Staaten River (1855), and at Aurukun, 150 km north-west of Coen (1913).

Monotypic.","As a result of extensive loss of feeding and breeding habitat, very rapid and continuing declines over the past three generations have been detected and further declines are almost certain. As a result, the species is classified as Endangered.<p></p>","It forages in woodland, shrubland and heathland, usually breeding in areas receiving 350-700 mm annual average rainfall (Saunders 1974, 1980). Flocks of non-breeding birds then move to coastal areas, where pine plantations have become important feeding and roosting sites since the 1930s (Saunders 1980, Department of Environment and Conservation, Western Australia 2012)<strong></strong>. It eats seeds of <em>Hakea</em>, <em>Grevillea</em>, <em>Banksia </em>(which now includes <em>Dryandra)</em>, <em>Allocasuarina</em>, <em>Eucalyptus</em>,&#160;but also feeds on the seeds of weeds and exotic pines, insect larvae and nectar (Saunders 1974b, 1980, 1982, 1990, Department of Environment and Conservation, Western Australia 2012)<strong></strong>. The species has also been recorded damaging persimmon and nut crops and the shoots of trees in orchards (Department of Environment and Conservation, Western Australia 2012)<strong></strong>. Its breeding success is dependent on the presence of heathland feeding areas within 12 km of its nesting habitat (Department of Environment and Conservation, Western Australia 2012, Saunders<em> et al. </em>2014a,&#160;<span class=""msoIns"">Saunders and Ingram 1987, Saunders 1982). It nests in hollows in large eucalypts, primarily salmon gum <em>E. salmonophloia</em> and wandoo <em>E. wandoo</em>. It is also now frequently found nesting in marri <em>Corymbia calophylla</em>, jarrah <em>E. marginate, </em>tuart&#160;<em>E. gomphocephala</em> and karri <em>E. diversicolor</em> forests (<span class=""msoIns"">Saunders 1979<span class=""msoIns"">a<span class=""msoIns"">,&#160;<span class=""msoIns"">Department&#160;<span class=""GramE"">of&#160;&#160;Environment&#160;and Conservation, Western Australia 2012)<strong></strong>. It is a long-lived species; females appear not to breed until they are at least four years old (Saunders 1982, 1986, Saunders and Ingram 1998)<strong></strong>, and the oldest known female was at least 25 in 2009 (Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2011a)<span class=""msoIns"">&#160;and subsequently 30 in 2014 (Saunders<em> et al. </em>unpublished data) and the oldest known male was 34<span class=""msoIns"">&#160;when found dead in 2008&#160;(Saunders and&#160;<span class=""msoIns"">Dawson 2009, Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2011). Observations suggest that pairs remain together until the death of one of the partners (Saunders 1982)<strong></strong>. The eggs are usually laid between early July and late September (Saunders 1990, Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2013)<strong></strong>, with timing of egg-laying being strongly influenced by rainfall in the first half of autumn (Saunders et al. 2013). Egg laying may continue into October or November (Saunders and Ingram 1998,&#160;Saunders <em>et al. </em>2013). Less than half of the nest hollows available in an area of breeding habitat may remain unoccupied due to aggressive interactions between females during the selection and preparation of hollows (Saunders 1982)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. It is known that some females return to the same nest hollows in successive years&#160;provided they have been successful the previous breeding season, and the hollow is unoccupied when they return to breed&#160;(Saunders 1982, 1990)<strong></strong>. The species usually lays two eggs on average up to eight days apart. The second to hatch usually dies within 48 hours (Saunders 1982, Saunders <em>et al. </em>2014a)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. In good seasons experienced females may fledge both nestlings (Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2014a). The incubation period is 28-29 days (Saunders 1979b, 1982)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Successful fledging of two chicks occurs in up to 6% of nesting attempts (Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Juveniles remain with their parents until they return to the breeding area at the start of the following season, and in some cases may associate with their parents for longer (Saunders 1982)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. This behaviour may be linked with the acquisition of knowledge and skills required for foraging (Saunders 1982)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.&#160;The egg-laying season has lengthened as a result of climate change (Saunders <em>et al. </em>2020b) with no effect on nestling growth rates or nestling body condition.<span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""GramE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","The primary reason for the decline in population has been the removal of breeding and feeding habitat, initially in the wheatbelt used for breeding but more recently on the coastal plain which is largely used by non-breeding birds (Richards <em>et al.</em> 2020). Remaining wheatbelt habitat is fragmented, threatened by rising soil salinity, weed invasion, <em>Phytophthora cinnamomi</em> dieback, and fire (Saunders 1990; Saunders and Ingram 1998) with little regeneration of nest trees for &gt;60 years because of grazing by sheep and rabbits <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> (Saunders 1979; Saunders <em>et al. </em>1982, 2003, 2014b). Food plant productivity, fire regimes and nest recruitment are all likely to be less favourable as rainfall declines, temperature increases, and drought is more frequent and intense as the climate changes (P. Mawson unpublished, in Saunders <em>et al</em>. 2021). The availability of freshwater for drinking may also limit numbers in dry years, given current trends in water availability in south-western waterways (Barron <em>et al</em>. 2012). Galahs <em>Eolophus roseicapilla</em>, Little Corellas <em>Cacatua sanguinea </em>and introduced<em> </em>Long-billed Corella<em> Cacatua tenuirostris</em> and European honey bees <em>Apis mellifera</em> compete for remaining hollows (Johnstone and Kirkby 1999; Johnstone <em>et al</em>. 2010; Saunders and Doley 2019). Nest-robbing for the bird trade is now thought to be infrequent but has damaged nest hollows (Saunders et al. 1985; Mawson and Johnstone 1997). Most feeding habitat in the wheatbelt has either been cleared or is too distant from breeding habitat to be used when breeding (Saunders <em>et al.</em> 1985; Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Less has been cleared in the jarrah forest. While birds feed at rehabilitated bauxite mines eight years after rehabilitation (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2013) despite disturbance from forestry activities and mining, such areas lack nest hollows. Lowland, coastal plain habitat is under intense pressure, partly because urban development is removing banksia woodland and partly because most of the large Gnangara-Pinjar-Yanchep pine plantation, which has sustained non-breeding birds for several decades, has been reduced from 30,000 ha to 5,000&#160;ha (Stock <em>et al</em>. 2013; Johnston <em>et al</em>. 2020) and the remaining trees, which support 70% of the Perth-Peel population in winter, will be cleared by 2025 at the current clearance rate of 1000&#160;ha/year (A Peck unpublished). Other causes of death that may affect population trends include road-kills (Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2011), being shot by landholders for damaging nut crops (Pitman<em> et al</em>. 2007), hindlimb paralysis potentially caused by ingestion of organophosphates (Le SouÃÂ«f <em>et al.</em> 2020), heat waves, and hailstorms (Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2011). Given market prices and that captive birds have low rates of breeding success, illegal poaching also poses a threat to the species as eggs and nestlings are taken from the wild for use in avicultural markets (White 2011).","<span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU"">The total population of Carnaby's Black-Cockatoo was estimated at 40,000 individuals in 2013&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">based on the expert opinion of the members of the CarnabyÃ¢ÂÂs Cockatoo Recovery Team members,&#160;but possibly &lt;10,000Ã¢ÂÂ60,000 (Mawson and Johnstone 1997, Department of Parks and Wildlife 2013). Overall the population is estimated to be in the range 20,000 to 52,000 with a best estimate of 34,000, which is also based on annual citizen science survey data (Peck <em>et al</em>. 2019).</span></span>","<em></em><p></p><p><span lang=""EN-AU"">Carnaby's Black-cockatoos are endemic to south-western <strong>Australia</strong>, occurring in a broad arc from Kalbarri in the north to Esperance in the south-east (Department of Parks and Wildlife 2013). However, there is a substantial break in the genetic structure of the population north of Albany that has developed since most of the species' breeding habitat there was cleared from the 1950s-1980s (White <em>et al.</em> 2014). Most breeding occurs between Three Springs and Ravensthorpe with the birds flying to the coast after breeding, but, after loss of a third of its breeding habitat between the 1970s and 1990s (Saunders and Ingram 1995), increasing numbers are now breeding at sites in the west and south-west (Johnstone <em>et al.</em> 2008, Johnstone and Kirkby 2019).

The threat of introduced predators remains a plausible threat. Hybridisation with&#160;Chatham Island red-fronted parakeets is an ongoing threat to the species which, despite culling, continues to establish itself in low numbers on Mangere Island (J.

In 2006 it was estimated that over 50% of the birds with Forbes' parakeet morphology may be hybrids (Chan <em>et al.</em> 2006).&#160;The previously high rate of hybridisation is believed to be the result of the previously low population sizes of the two species (D.

Greene&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2012).&#160;A survey in 2011 assessed the phenotypes of concern to be at 10%, the trigger level for management action (D. Houston<em> in litt.</em> 2012). However, number of hybrids appear to have stabilised or declined since (T. Greene<em> in litt.</em> 2020). It is therefore thought that levels of hybridisation have remained below 10% of the total Mangere Island parakeet population for the past decade, and so no management intervention has been necessary. Currently the population of hybrid birds is monitored, and culls will resume if the number of hybrid birds on Mangere Island reaches 10% of the total number of parakeets on the island.","The population of <em>forbesi</em>-like phenotypes has increased dramatically on Mangere Island in the past as a result of habitat management and exotic predator control. The Little Mangere Island population is poorly known due to few visits taking place (H. Aikman <em>in litt.</em> 1999). In 1999, the total population was estimated to be about 120 birds (Aikman et al. 2001), but surveys in 2003 estimated 900 individuals on Mangere Island (Aikman and Miskelly 2004, D. Houston and C. Miskelly <em>in litt.</em> 2008) following culling of <em>Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae</em>. Since then it has likely decreased to 600-700 mature individuals with rapid regeneration and planting of vegetation (T. Greene <em>in litt.</em> 2020). A survey in 2011 assessed the phenotypes of concern to be at 10%, the trigger level for management action (D. Houston <em>in litt.</em> 2012) but number of hybrids appear to have stabilised or declined since (T. Greene <em>in litt.</em> 2020).&#160;The population has exceeded 250 mature individuals for well over 5 years and is currently thought to be stable (Robertson <em>et al. </em>2021), so it is placed in the range of 250-999 mature individuals.","<em>Cyanoramphus forbesi</em> is restricted to Little Mangere and Mangere Islands in the Chatham Island group, <strong>New Zealand</strong>.

Monotypic.,This species is listed as Vulnerable because remote-sensing techniques indicate that the lowland forest on which this species depends for nesting is being cleared at such a rate that the population is likely to be undergoing a rapid decline.<p></p>,"It occurs in primary forest, selectively logged forest, and, at lower densities, forest gardens (Marsden <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). However,&#160;it appears to rely on intact forest with large trees for nesting (Marsden <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001; Marsden and Pilgrim 2003). It has been recorded up to c.1,600 m (Igag 2009). It feeds on fruits including coconut <em>Cocos nucifera</em>, <em>Melanolepis multiglandulosa</em> and <em>Ficus sp.</em>, and flowers including <em>Eucalyptus deglupta</em> and <em>Cryptocarya sp.</em> (Marsden <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001; Marsden and Pilgrim 2003).","It is threatened by logging and forest conversion, particularly for conversion to oil palm plantations. Around 12% of forest cover in New Britain was lost between 1989 and 2000 (Buchanan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Since then, the rate of deforestation apparently slowed (B. Beehler&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016, Global Forest Watch 2021).<br/><br/>In 2002, all forest in West New Britain was allocated for industrial forestry, and New Britain accounted for approximately half of Papua New Guinea's timber exports (Bun&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Regulations on the frequency of re-logging areas are being ignored (Nelson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/>Many areas of lowland forest in New Britain have been converted to oil palm plantations (Swartzendruber 1993; Buchanan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Much of the Bismarck Archipelago&#160;has been allocated as Special Agricultural Business Lease (SABL) areas, which would permit conversion to oil palm plantations. However, many of these areas appear to be unsuitable for oil palm, suggesting that they may be in place to facilitate commercial logging, under the pretext of oil palm development (Nelson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014; Bryan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Nevertheless, conversion to oil palm is likely to continue slowly in the region (Nelson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><p></p>The species is trapped in low numbers to be kept as a pet, and is traded internationally in small numbers. Approximately 15 individuals were found on sale at a market in Kokopo, New Britain in 1996 (Wilkinson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2000) and 38&#160;wild individuals were imported to CITES signatory countries in 1996-1997 (Marsden <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001; WCMC CITES Database). However, very few imports of wild individuals were reported since 2000 (WCMC CITES Database) and extensive surveys in 1997-1998 and 2010 found no evidence of poaching (Davis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).","It is usually encountered in pairs, but birds may congregate in flocks of up to 40 individuals (Marsden&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001). The species was frequently encountered in primary and disturbed forest during surveys in 1997-1998 and 2010 (Davis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Its population density has been estimated at 27 (+/- 12) and 73 (+/- 24) individuals per km<sup>2</sup> in primary forest, 64 (+/- 24) individuals per km<sup>2</sup> in selectively logged forest, and 6 (+/- 3.5) and 28 (+/- 20) individuals per km<sup>2</sup> in forest gardens (Marsden <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001). It is widely distributed across the island, and in 1996 most remaining forest was considered to be of adequate quality to support a reasonal population density (Marsden <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001). However, parrot species are known to make altitudinal and seasonal movements, so occupancy may not be uniform across all available habitat (Marsden <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). Based on the lowest density estimate across all habitats (6 individuals per km<sup>2</sup>), the lowest density estimate for primary forest (26 individuals per km<sup>2</sup>), and an estimated area of forest of&#160;19,200 km<sup>2</sup> in 1996, the population size was previously tentatively estimated at approximately 115,000 - 499,000 individuals (Marsden <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). The area of forest cover in 2000 was later estimated at&#160;21,833 km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Buchanan <em>et al. </em>2008). Based on the same density estimates and the new estimate of forest area, the population estimate can be revised to c. 131,000 - 568,000 individuals.

Detections of this species were negatively associated with disturbed habitats (Oleiro and Kesler 2015).<br/>It feeds on nectar, pollen and fruit, particularly favouring nectar from coral trees <em>Erythrina fusca</em> and mango <em>Mangifera indica</em> fruit<strong></strong>, but also noted to favour flowers of coconuts, bananas and <em>Elaeocarpus</em> species (Engbring <em>et al</em>. 1990; Juniper and Parr 1998)<strong></strong>. The species nests in the tops of coconut palms or in cavities in large trees (Juniper and Parr 1998)<strong></strong>, but also shows a preference for <em>Xylocarpus </em>mangroves (Engbring <em>et al</em>. 1990)<strong></strong>. Nesting generally takes place from December to May, although there is evidence of breeding outside this period, and only one egg is laid by each female (Juniper and Parr 1998)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","Although the species is known to use a range of habitats, it may have suffered some negative effects from deforestation, which has been rapid. Overall, there was a reduction of undisturbed upland forest on Pohnpei of over 60% from 1975 to 1995 (Buden 1996, 2000; B. Raynor <em>in litt</em>. 1995, 2012; Oleiro and Kesler 2015). The majority of the island's forests have been to various degrees converted or at least degraded to mixed forest (native species mixed with lowland secondary species), largely attributable to the cultivation of sakau (= kava) <em>Piper methysticum</em> as a major cash-crop (B. Raynor <em>in litt. </em>2012). The fragmentation of such forest by sakau clearings also introduces and encourages the spread of invasive species in isolated areas throughout the forest. Although efforts over the past 20 years to reduce the amount of clear-cutting for sakau plantations have resulted in the slowing of native forest conversion rates, the trend remains negative (B. Raynor <em>in litt. </em>2012). There is a history of this species being hunted for food, persecuted for its perceived pest status and superstitious associations, and captured for trade, with the presence of some birds in captivity suggesting that nest poaching is still taking place (J. R. Gilardi<em> in litt</em>. 2010, 2011; M. O'Brien<em> in litt</em>. 2011)<strong></strong>. Its pest status may be exaggerated, as it apparently only inflicts minor damage on crops such as mangoes (Engbring <em>et al</em>. 1990)<strong></strong>. Climate change and sea level rise may impact this species in future by causing the loss and degradation of its mangrove habitat (Oleiro and Kesler 2015).&#160;<p></p>","Using spatially explicit habitat models linked to density functions conducted, Oleiro and Kesler (2015)&#160;estimated a population of 100,803 individuals on Pohnpei.

The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.",,"The most important current threat is extensive and  intense fires that temporarily remove habitat and can  potentially extirpate isolated subpopulations, although  there is proven resilience to a range of fire regimes  (Baker <em>et al. </em>2010). In some places habitat rapidly  becomes suitable again after good rains: at Yuragir  National Park birds were present at two sites a year after  a severe fire in numbers similar to those detected before  the fire (M. Andren unpublished). Extreme fire weather  is likely to increase in frequency (Di Virgilio <em>et al.</em> 2019, Dowdy <em>et al.</em> 2019), driven by increases in the frequency  and severity of drought and heat waves (Evans <em>et al. </em> 2017, Herold <em>et al. </em>2018). Conversely, a lack of fire  leading to succession by tall shrubby vegetation appears  to have caused extirpation of the Otway Ranges population (G. Dutson unpublished). As a ground nester,  Ground Parrots may be susceptible to predation by cats  <em>Felis catus</em> and foxes <em>Vulpes vulpes</em>, particularly immediately after a fire (Lindenmayer <em>et al. </em>2009, Woinarski  <em>et al.</em> 2017). Most subpopulations are in relatively intact  protected areas but south of the Noosa River in Queensland, the cumulative effects of urban development,  stormwater run-off, sewage discharge and an unsuitable  fire regime is thought to be leading to a gradual replacement of the nutrient poor-heathland habitat needed by  the parrots with taller native and introduced weeds  (K.A. land unpublished). Also, relatively high rate of  hatching failure in the subpopulation in south-east Queensland  (McFarland 1991c) may be related to a particularly low  rate of genetic variability (Chan <em>et al.</em> 2008) but has not  been investigated.","The size of the eastern population estimated  from published sources (Garnett <em>et al.</em> 2011; NSW OEH  2016, 2019) to have been 5,700 (5,200Ã¢ÂÂ8,300) after fires in  2019Ã¢ÂÂ2020 killed an estimated 18% of birds (13Ã¢ÂÂ24%  depending on the mortality scenario) based on maps of  fire severity in 2019Ã¢ÂÂ2020 within the pre-fire range and initial assumptions about mortality at different fire severity classes (fire severity low: 10%; medium: 30%; high: 80%; very high: 100%).&#160;A true estimate of the western population has never been possible given the density of the habitat  and cryptic nature of the bird (Burbidge <em>et al.</em> 2007; DPaW  2014), but an estimated population of 100 seems likely  given recent losses (S Comer unpublished; in Comer <em>et al. </em>2021).

In Australia, it inhabits closed forest, but occurs at the highest densities in open woodland (Heinsohn <em>et al</em>. 2021).","In Australia, nest hollow availability appears to be the main constraint on abundance and is affected primarily by fire regime which both creates and destroys hollow and also affects the rate of spread of rainforest hollows are at a lower density (Heinsohn <em>et al</em>.&#160;2021). Hollow abundance is also affected by the clearance of woodland for bauxite mining (TSSC 2015), cyclones and competition with Sulphur-crested Cockatoos <em>Cacatua galerita</em>, which may have increased near Weipa (TSSC 2015). Elsewhere (in New Guinea), the chief threats are forest loss to make way for urban areas and plantations, as well as selective timber extraction. <br/>Trapping for pet trade is an ongoing threat and may accelerate as areas of forest become more accessible due to increasing road infrastructure. The impact of trapping for trade remains unquantified and poorly  understood, but both local (Pangau-Adam and Noske 2010) and  international (Sy 2010) trade of this species has been documented.

Locally, the species may be killed for food and/or ornamentation.","The global population size has not previously been accurately estimated but it remains regularly observed through its range (eBird 2022). In Australia, the endemic taxon&#160;<em>macgillivrayi </em>is reliably estimated to number 1,800-2,600 mature individuals, with a best estimate of c.2,200 (Heinsohn <em>et al</em>. 2021).

Assuming the densities collated at a single site in Papua New Guinea are representative for elsewhere in New Guinea (including satellites), and that only a percentage (arbitrarily set here to 40Ã¢ÂÂ80%) of the range is occupied, the population is estimated to number c.260,000Ã¢ÂÂ640,000 mature individuals.","This species is found in <strong>Australia </strong>and New Guinea (West Papua, <strong>Indonesia</strong> and <strong>Papua New Guinea</strong>).

Some of these apply also to the much larger New Guinea population, although here there is a more basic need to understand the key threats impacting on the species, particularly the extent to which trapping is ongoing and driving population declines. In New Guinea remote sensing data should also be used to monitor the scale of forest cover loss over time; because this species has dependence on large, old trees, this will need to be reinforced by ground-truthing surveys.&#160;Investigate the scale and trend of trade globally, particularly those thought to have originated from New Guinea.&#160;Enforce the species' CITES Appendix I listing and monitor trade, and the extent of its impact on wild populations.

It feeds at flowers of canopy trees and epiphytes (Pratt and Beehler 2015).","Its habitat is locally under threat from logging and clearance for agriculture; however, large areas of forest remain across much of its range, and the rugged terrain present in many areas affords ongoing protection against some anthropogenic processes (I. Woxvold <em>in litt. </em>2020). Reports of the species in Ok Tedi dropped dramatically following the severe drought in 1997-1998 (P. Gregory <em>in litt.</em> 2010), suggesting the species may be susceptible to climate-driven change in the availability of flower/nectar resources (I. Woxvold <em>in litt. </em>2020). Some populations may be impacted by mining activity at Ok Tedi in Papua New Guinea and at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, but the impacts of these developments are likely to be localised. The Ok Tedi open pit is mostly above the upper elevation limit reported for this species, and all or most Ok Tedi/Tabubil area records are from well below the pit site, but infrastructure and tailings from both mines may have localised influence on suitable habitat (I.

While its population is suspected of still being relatively large, trapping for the cagebird trade is ongoing at a scale thought to be driving moderately rapid declines: this is especially true in Indochina, where populations in Lao PDR and Viet Nam have declined very rapidly over the past three decades. In some range states (particularly India and Thailand) populations may be stable or declining only slowly. Habitat loss and degradation may be an additive threat to this species especially in South-East Asia where the species has a strong affinity to lowland deciduous dipterocarp forest. Evaluating its global status, the species is assessed as Near Threatened due to rates of population reduction suspected to approach the threatened thresholds. The impacts of trapping must be monitored closely, especially alongside evidence of population declines in range states where the species is currently considered comparatively secure.","This species occurs in the lowlands to c.1,500 m, inhabiting light forest, including savanna, secondary growth, forest edge, clearings and cultivated areas (Juniper and Parr 1998). It is particularly associated with dry deciduous forest throughout south-east Asia (Goes 2013, R. J. Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013); although it is occasionally observed in semi-evergreen forest, it seems to be dependent on drier habitat (Goes 2013, W. Duckworth <em>in litt. </em>2016). It is able to persist in partially deforested landscapes and appears to favour forest edge near cultivation (Juniper and Parr 1998). It breeds in January-May, nesting in tree cavities and laying a clutch of usually 4-5 eggs (Juniper and Parr 1998).","Capture for the cagebird trade is the chief threat to this species throughout its range, having caused the near-extirpation of it from parts of its range (e.g. Lao PDR: Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press.). There are few empirical examples of the scale of this trade, although at a single site in Myanmar between December 2018 and April 2019,&#160;1,744 individuals were reported for sale from (Thin Thin Khaing 2019). It is also obscure what percentage of the trade in this species is international, although the appearance of birds in markets in Indonesia (not a range state) (Chng&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018) suggests that to some degree, birds are traded internationally. Although the species is listed in CITES Appendix II, there are very few trade records (CITES Trade Database 2023: all from Europe and likely refer to captively bred birds) suggesting that this mechanism is ineffective at monitoring trade currently. Habitat loss and degradation is considered a secondary threat. This species is very tolerant of habitat degradation and occurs, for example, in forest edge interspersed with cultivation (Juniper and Parr 1998). However, at least in South-East Asia, the species shows a strong affinity for lowland deciduous dipterocarp forests which have been subject to some of the most intensive habitat modifications in Indochina. Accordingly, habitat loss has locally likely contributed to some extent to declines; Timmins <em>et al</em>. (in press.) considered in Lao PDR that although habitat loss and degradation is unlikely to have been a proximate cause of population collapse, it ""could perhaps limit any future recovery if hunting is controlled"".","The global population size has not been quantified, but the overall abundance appears to be much reduced across its range in recent decades (Collar and Kirwan 2017). In Lao PDR and Viet Nam, now very scarce (Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press., eBird 2023), but in India, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia it remains locally common (Goes 2013, Thin Thin Khaing and Khin Myint Mar 2019, eBird 2023).","Blossom-headed Parakeet occurs in South and South-East Asia, ranging from <strong>Nepal </strong>(most recent records from Chitwan National Park: eBird 2023), east through the Himalayan foothills to north-east&#160;<strong>India</strong> and south to eastern<strong> Bangladesh</strong><strong></strong>, through most of&#160;<strong>Myanmar</strong>&#160;and neighbouring western Yunnan, <strong>China</strong>.&#160;It is widespread in&#160;<strong>Thailand </strong>(north of the peninsula) and <strong>Cambodia</strong>, but is highly localised in <strong>Lao PDR </strong>and <strong>Viet Nam</strong>, where now only known from sporadic records in the south of both countries. Similarly, there are no recent records from Guangxi and Guangdong provinces in southern China, despite historic occurrence there. Although the species is yet to have been entirely extirpated from any range state, the overall EOO is thought to have reduced from 3,870,000 km<sup>2</sup> three decades ago, to only 2,670,000 km<sup>2</sup> now. If the current threats continue, extinction in Lao PDR and Viet Nam are possible.<br/><br/>Given this species' use in the pet trade, it is perhaps unsurprising that this species occasionally escapes and turns up elsewhere. For example, there are several records from urban centres including Singapore and Hong Kong (eBird 2023) but it is not considered established here or anywhere else outside its native range. It is mostly sedentary, with some localised seasonal movements (presumably in response to food pressures).","Capture for the cagebird trade is the chief threat to this species throughout its range, having caused the near-extirpation of it from parts of its range (e.g. Lao PDR: Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press.).

Listed in CITES Appendix II.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Because habitat loss and degradation are considered only secondary threats for this species, the most important threat to address is that of trapping. In particular, this species should be protected in all range states and those where it is must ensure legislation is upheld. There is an urgent need to better quantify the impact of trade on wild populations. Long-term, the most successful way to address trapping is with community engagement, in particular, the need for awareness-raising activities to discourage nest-robbing and trapping. Timmins <em>et al</em>. (in press.) noted that in Lao PDR, habitat degradation may now or soon be at a scale that limits recovery potential; accordingly, although this species <em>is </em>tolerant of fragmented and degraded forest landscapes, there is undoubtedly a need to robustly protect areas of dry deciduous forest for this and other species dependent on this biome. Rates of forest loss should continue to be monitored using remote sensing data.","(Biswas, 1951)"

Monotypic.,"Endemic to Seram, Indonesia, <em>Cacatua moluccensis</em>&#160;is listed as Endangered because it is suspected to have declined by more than 50% over the past three generations (64 years). The principal driver of these declines has been rampant trapping for the pet trade, compounded by the impacts of logging and encroaching agriculture on lowland forests.<br/><p></p>","It is largely resident (although perhaps subject to minor local movements) in lowland rainforest up to 1,400 m (Eaton<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2021).&#160;Studies have shown it to occur in higher densities in primary and secondary forest (<em>vs </em>recently logged forest) (Marsden 1995, Marsden and Fielding 1999). Furthermore, the highest densities in unlogged forest were encountered below 180 m, clearly illustrating the importance of primary lowland forest. Another recent study found no significant difference between use of a number of land-use types but found that abundance was positively linked to the presence of strangler figs and suitable large nesting trees (Kinnaird <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. Diet consists of berries, nuts, seeds, coconuts and insects and their larvae. <p></p>","By the 1980s the species was being extensively and unsustainably trapped for the cage-bird market, with an estimated 74,509 individuals exported from Indonesia between 1981 and 1990, and international imports averaging 9,751 per annum between 1983 and 1988 (BirdLife International 2001). Although reported international trade fell to zero in the 1990s, trappers have remained highly active and birds are openly sold within Indonesia (Metz and Nursahid 2004, Nandika <em>et al</em>. 2021)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.&#160;Illegal trade continued to be prolific during religious riots in 2004 (C. Shepherd <em>in litt</em>. 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and baseline estimates suggest 4,000 birds were removed from the wild annually in domestic trade alone. More recently, birds continue to be reported in international trade (Emerson <em>et al</em>. 2022, CITES Trade Database 2023) and are evidently still traded domestically (Nandika <em>et al</em>. 2021). However, current rates of trend are thought to be slower than those 20-30 years ago, with the protection of all Indonesian parrot species by law apparently having led to a reduction in the number of confiscations of this species (Nandika <em>et al</em>. 2021). Forest loss, degradation and fragmentation have likely compounded population declines over the past three generations, with rates of lowland forest loss increasing on Seram since 2014 (Global Forest Watch 2023) and projections anticipate even more rapid rates of forest loss in the future (Voigt <em>et al</em>. 2021). In addition to the obvious reduction in the extent of suitable habitat, selective logging and the removal of larger trees likely compounds long-term declines and population viability in this species, which depends on tree hollows for nesting.","The population size of this species is not robustly known, but there is evidence that it is considerably smaller now than the <em>c</em>.110,000 birds (95% CI: 62,400-195,000) estimated in 1998 (Kinnaird <em>et al</em>. 2003). In reaching this latter estimate, Kinnaird <em>et al</em>. (2003) extrapolated estimated densities from seven sites across the island (which varied 0.93-17.25 birds/km<sup>2</sup>; mean 7.9 birds/km<sup>2</sup>). More recent densities from some areas (Nandika <em>et al</em>. 2021) indicate that while where the species is well protected densities have remained high (up to&#160;15.28 birds/km<sup>2</sup>), elsewhere the density has collapsed (to 1.6 birds/km<sup>2</sup>)<sup> </sup>even in good forest where Kinnaird <em>et al</em>. (2003) recorded their highest densities. For much of Seram, this latter estimate is now probably most representative.&#160;<br/>The population is estimated to have declined by 50-79% over three generations (i.e. since 1959), but there is little resolution in how much it has declined more recently (i.e. since the late 1990s, when the Kinnaird <em>et al</em>. [2003] estimate was made). Over this time period, declines have almost certainly not been constant, making predictions especially difficult. Assuming a reduction since the 1990s of between 30-70%, with a best estimate of 40-60%, the population is estimated at 33,000-77,000, best estimate 44,000-66,000 birds. Not all of these are likely to be mature individuals, although additional uncertainty is then presented by determining what ratio of mature individuals: birds should be applied. It is assumed that somewhere between 60 and 80% of birds are mature adults, hence the number of mature individuals is estimated at 26,000-53,000. While it is noted that a population on Ambon does persist, this is now so small that it is unlikely to affect the broad bands used above.","<em>Cacatua moluccensis</em> is endemic to Seram, Ambon, Saparua and Haruku in South Maluku, <strong>Indonesia</strong>. There are no recent records from Saparua and Haruku, and only a small population persists on Ambon leaving almost the entire population on Seram.<br/> <p></p>","Trapping for the pet trade is the biggest threat to this species and is thought responsible for the rapid declines estimated over the past three generations (Nandika <em>et al</em>. 2021). Most of the trade in the species now is probably domestic (i.e. within Indonesia), particularly to Java where large numbers of birds are kept as pets. However, the species has also been recorded being extensively traded in the Philippines (Emerson <em>et al</em>. 2022). BirdLife International (2001) concludedÃ¢ÂÂperhaps, if anything, conservativelyÃ¢ÂÂthat at least 10,000&#160;<em>C. moluccensis</em>&#160;were taken from Seram annually (these numbers were calculated using export and import reports to CITES, thus mostly refer to international trade); such high volumes of trade are not thought to be ongoing however.","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>It has been listed in Appendix I and II of CITES since 1989, a measure that effectively curtailed reported trade at the international level. It occurs in Manusela National Park on Seram, although this evidently does not confer adequate protection from trapping (Nandika <em>et al</em>. 2021). The species has captive-breeding populations at multiple centres, although there is not currently a coordinated conservation programme.&#160;<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Ensure this species and the lowland forests it depends on are truly protected, requiring an expansion of the protected area network (as well as consideration of OECMs) and adequate enforcement.

The population is inferred to be declining due to ongoing pressure from the pet trade, as well as compounding impacts of forest loss and degradation.<p></p>","It inhabits hill and submontane rainforest, sometimes preferring ridges, within a fairly restricted altitudinal range (between 300 and 1,300 m, but only common between 600 and 1,000 m). It lives in pairs or scattered flocks and is thought to be largely sedentary.<p></p>","The main threat to this species is capture for the pet trade. Reportedly kept in villages and towns in large numbers on Seram itself and there is evidence from confiscations that it is exported nationally to other islands in Indonesia (e.g. Maulany&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021, Nandika&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021). Habitat loss and degradation are also key threats, driven principally by timber extraction and shifting agriculture/plantations.&#160;Annual rates of loss appear to be accelerating (Global Forest Watch 2024) and Seram's hill forests are considered vulnerable to exploitation in the coming decades (see Voigt <em>et al</em>. 2020). Over the past three generations (26 years: 1998-2023) forest cover in this species' range declined by c. 5%, a figure calculated using data from Global Forest Watch (2024) and Hansen <em>et al</em>. (2013), projecting back for two years (1998-1999) as data are available only from the year 2000. This does not account for additional impacts of degradation however, including selective logging removing hollow-bearing trees on which <em>L. domicella</em>&#160;is dependent on for nesting.<p></p>","Evidently always rather scarce (or heavily traded/exploited for such a long time that even the earliest ornithological explorations found it to be a rare species); Stresemann (1914) found it to be nowhere common, and it is striking that on his visit to the island in 1859, A. R. Wallace never obtained a specimen (Wallace 1861). Fieldwork in south-west Seram in September 1983 failed to find it (Bishop 1992) and in 1987 in Manusela National Park it was encountered at a rate of only 0.7 birds per hour (Bowler and Taylor 1989). It was later found to be locally common however, especially on higher/less accessible ridges most remote from hunters (Isherwood <em>et al</em>. 1997, Willis 1997) but in the last 30 years a proliferation of roads and hunting tracks have made very few areas of central Seram's forest truly remote (but see below). Expert opinion is consistent in believing this species' global population size to be very small: BirdLife International (2001) considered the population to be &lt;2,500 mature individuals more than two decades ago based on a consolidation of available records and survey effort, while surveys in 2020 led Nandika <em>et al</em>. (2021) to conclude that the population 'might be below 250'. The latter authors found a density of 2.3 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in Manusela NP however, which maintains <em>c</em>. 900km<sup>2</sup> of suitable habitat within this species' elevational range, such that even if only a small proportion of the national park is occupied, it seems likely that the national park alone continues to support more than 250 mature individuals (and probably &gt;500). Recent records away from those published by Nandika <em>et al</em>. (2021) are very few, and most observations are made in Manusela National Park, where it continues to be observed regularly, but in small numbers, by visiting birdwatchers (eBird 2024). Numbers outside the national park may now be very small to negligible, a suggestion that finds some support in the data of Persulessy and Putuhena (2020) who, in surveys of seven localities within a production forest adjacent to Manusela NP, found only three <em>L. domicella</em>&#160;at a single site in 2015-2018. These localities, however, were very close to human habitation, and there remains extensive areas of suitable habitat in western Seram, which has not been surveyed in recent years. A highly precautionary approach would be to assume the species has been effectively extirpated from areas not under formal protection, in which case there may be as few as <em>c</em>. 500 mature individuals. Alternatively, the species may maintain strongholds in remoter areas of the island, and the population size could be an order of magnitude greater. Accordingly the species' population size is estimated to number 500-5,000 mature individuals, but more surveys are needed in areas of Seram away from Manusela National Park.","<em>Lorius domicella</em> is endemic to Seram, <strong>Indonesia</strong>.&#160;Escapes are sometimes seen on Ambon, and the status of records from Haruku and Sparua are unknown, but probably refer to escapes. It appears always to have been uncommon or rare, recent records deriving only from within Manusela National Park in central Seram.<p></p>","Capture for the pet trade is considered the chief threat to this species, which is thought to be suffering continuing declines because of it. Reportedly kept in villages and towns in large numbers on Seram itself and there is evidence from confiscations that it is exported nationally to other islands in Indonesia (e.g. Maulany&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021, Nandika&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021).","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Listed in CITES Appendix II and protected under Indonesian law since 1972.

It is highly likely that this trade is domestic, with birds from West Timor (Indonesia) fuelling demand for cagebirds further west in Indonesia.

Combined, these populations are now thought to number as few as 300-800 mature individuals, with plausibly no more than 250 mature individuals in the largest subpopulation. The global population is probably still declining in response to ongoing habitat loss and degradation, as well as hunting. Accordingly this species is facing a very high risk of extinction, and therefore is listed as Endangered.<br/><p></p>","It is a species of the lowlands and foothills on Luzon, with records up to 1,000 m on Marinduque (where now extinct), but mostly below 700 m. While birds readily scatter into heavily degraded forests and open lands for foraging, it appears to be in some way dependent on lowland forests, probably for breeding.<p></p>","Trapping for the cage-bird trade is a significant problem. Habitat loss has likely been a significant cause of declines over the past five decades, with almost all lowland forest on Luzon being cleared. While this species often visits degraded landscapes for foraging, it is probably dependent on relatively intact forests for breeding. Forest losses have been driven by a combination of shifting agriculture, local clearing of land, and much larger scale forestry. More recently, losses have been attritional and most likely caused by localised logging and land clearance; in some areas, this process has been allowed and expanded by the creation of new roads and tracks granting loggers (and trappers) access to hitherto remote forests. Preference for larger trees for selective logging may also have a disproportionate impact on this hollow-nesting species. There is also wholly unquantified evidence that this species in modified habitats may be being outcompeted/replaced by <em>Prioniturus discurus</em>.<p></p>","The population size is now probably very small. Historically described as fairly common to abundant (e.g. Whitehead 1899, Gilliard 1950, Collar and Andrew 1988) but by the turn of the 21st century was already described as 'very rare on Luzon, and numbers must be small on Marinduque' (BirdLife International 2001). Now almost certainly extirpated from large parts of its range, including Marinduque, Quezon region and the Cordillera Mountains. Most recently described as 'rare and very local' (Allen 2020) and citizen science data (eBird 2024) affirm this suggestion, with records from only west Luzon (Zambales Mountains south to Subic Bay area [including Bataan NP]) and the Sierra Madre mountains.&#160;Distance sampling along nearly 500Ã¢ÂÂkm of line transects at 14 sites across Luzon in 2009-2010 multiplied by site-specific density estimates across reserve area, resulted in estimates of 246 individuals (95% CI: 42-1,434) in Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park, and 174 (95% CI: 80-380) in Subic Bay Forest Reserve/Bataan Natural Park (EspaÃÂ±ola <em>et al.</em> 2013). An additional population in the Zambales Mountains north of the latter was not surveyed but encounter rates there appear broadly similar to Subic Bay/Bataan (eBird 2024) and the area of suitable habitat is also similar, thus an equivalent population here is also estimated. All populations have likely declined since the estimates were made by EspaÃÂ±ola&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2013) given ongoing threats of habitat loss and trapping, particularly in the Sierra Madre where these are perhaps most acute and from which there are very few records over the past decade (notwithstanding limited survey effort). Contemporary population sizes are therefore estimated at: 100-300 in the Sierra Madre, and 100-250 in each of the Subic Bay Forest Reserve/Bataan NP and Zambales Mountains, giving a total population size of 300-800 mature individuals.","<em>Prioniturus luconensis</em> is endemic to the <strong>Philippines</strong>, where it is known from Luzon and Marinduque, but is almost certainly extinct on the latter. Recent records come from two regions: the Sierra Madre mountains in the north-east of Luzon, and the Subic Bay/Bataan NP/Zambles Mountains region in the west.<p></p>","Trapping is likely to be a significant threat to this species, in as much as habitat loss does not obviously explain the entirety of observed declines and range contractions. However, the rate of declines caused is unknown and the population is now so small that the trade of birds is very likely to go undetected.","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II.

It<em>&#160;</em>is present in both national bird markets, e.g. Guiyang, South-West China (Dai and Zhang 2017), as well as international markets e.g. in Algeria for $2044 per individual (Idir&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2023), in the West Bank, Palestine (Handal&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2023), in Singapore (Eaton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017) and Taiwan (J. Eaton&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2024). Whilst it is not entirely clear if these are wild caught or captive bred individuals, the implication that the species is considered highly valuable and sold both nationally and internationally persists. Despite this, the rate of decline is not thought to be rapid.&#160;In most cases only one to two individuals are being sold at a market.&#160;Additionally, the species is evidently commonest at remote high altitudes where there is minimal exploitation.<p></p>","<p>The population size has not been quantified, however Praveen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2015) suggested that the species may be considered a regular inhabitant given the number of records within Meshai, Anjaw, Arunachal Pradesh. Similarly, Grimmet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(1998) note the species' common in Arunachal Pradesh. MacKinnon and Phillips (2000) further describe the species as abundant in hill and montane forests across Tibet, south-west Sichuan, and west and north-west Yunnan up to 4,000 m.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>","<em>Psittacula derbiana</em> is primarily a resident species in Tibet, <strong>China</strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1997, Praveen et al. 2015) and has been described as a common local resident in Arunachal Pradesh, <strong>India </strong>(Grimmet <em>et al.</em> 1998), likely based on observations by Singh (1995). Kazmierczak (2000) also classified the species as resident in the region. However, Praveen <em>et al.</em> (2015) noted it as a breeding visitor to parts of Arunachal Pradesh, with presence between May and September. Maheswaran <em>et al. </em>(2022) observed daily movements between Arunachal Pradesh and China in May 2021 and March 2022, reporting that the species is common and regular in the area and suggesting that breeding is highly likely.<br/><br/>It also occurred from Assam, India, to southern China, including south-eastern Tibet, western Szechwan and western Yunnan (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997, Juniper and Parr 1998). However, more recently, the species' range has appeared to have contracted to the Tibetan border in some areas, although a single population persists in Yunnan to the south (J.

The latter course is preferred, building on Braun&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2016), where several genera were established or resurrected including&#160;<em>Belocercus</em><em>&#160;</em>for&#160;<em>P. longicauda</em>.","<em>Belocercus longicaudus&#160;</em>is expected to have undergone a rapid population reduction in excess of 30% over the past three generations due to the continued loss of suitable habitat and trapping for the bird trade. There is also a projected reduction of more than 30% in its population over the next three generations due to the likely continuation of these threats. Although the species can utilise modified habitats, it is dependent on mature forest for nesting, and therefore is susceptible to habitat degradation alongside overall forest loss.<p></p>","<em>B. longicaudus</em> is an extreme lowland species occurring up to 300 m but preferring coastal regions, including mangroves, swamp forest (including peatswamp forest), forest edge, partly cleared land, oil-palm plantations, and coconut groves (van Marle and Voous 1988, Collar <em>et al.</em> 2020, Eaton <em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). Although the species feeds in plantations, rural parks, and gardens, it is dependent on forest for breeding (Puan <em>et al.</em> 2020) and communal nesting (Collar <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020, Eaton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). It&#160;is nomadic, and has poorly understood fluctuations throughout its range (Collar <em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). The species may occur or arrive suddenly in an area in large flocks, then be subsequently absent for several years (Collar <em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/><p></p>","<em>B. longicaudus</em> is a lowland specialist, dependent on intact mangroves and swamp forest (including peatswamp forest) for breeding (Collar <em>et al.&#160;</em>2020, Puan <em>et al</em>. 2020). The range of&#160;<em>B. longicaudus&#160;</em>has experienced a considerable loss of forest over the past several decades, including 38-45% loss in the three generations (21 years) to 2023 (Global Forest Watch 2024, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;[2013] and methods disclosed therein). This is similar to Symes&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2018), who predicted habitat loss to have contributed to a 33.8% decline over the next three generations (based on recent remote sensing data). Although the species&#160;occupies plantations, parks, and gardens sites (Jambari<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2012, Amit<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2014, Puan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020), forest loss is still likely to be an accurate predictor of population declines as the species breeds colonially in tree cavities found mostly in undisturbed forest (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020, Puan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020, Eaton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021).<br/><em><br/>B. longicaudus</em>&#160;is additionally threatened from the illegal pet trade, a widespread hobby across the speciesÃ¢ÂÂ range (Jepson and Ladle 2005). The species has been recorded in illegal trade markets from 1997 to 2001 in North Sumatra (Shepherd 2006), in South Sumatra in 2015 (Iqbal 2015), and Enganno Island in 2020 (Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). The species has even been noted in weekend markets in Thailand (Chng and Eaton 2016). The species is also subject to online bird trading (mainly private Facebook groups), which has provided enhanced reach for the trade in Indonesia (Iqbal 2015). An estimated 2,143 individuals were exported annually between 1986 and 1990, mostly from Malaysia (Collar <em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>Although plantations provide suitable feeding habitat for the&#160;<em>B. longicaudus</em>, they also present additional threat via hunting. The species may be perceived as an agricultural pest and consequentially shot or hunted&#160;(Iqbal <em>et al.</em> 2020).","There have been no surveys of the populations size of <em>B. longicaudus</em> and the population size is therefore considered unknown. However, the species is described as very common and widespread in South Kalimantan, locally common on Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, as occurring in very large numbers in Brunei, and common in the Andamans and Nicobars (Collar <em>et al.</em> 2020, Eaton <em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). It has also been described as common and 'easy to find' on Enggano (Iqbal <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The species can sometimes be observed in large communal roosts consisting of more than 1,000 individuals (Eaton <em>et al. </em>2021).&#160;Given a large predicted area of occupancy (822,000 km<sup>2</sup>: sRedList [2023]) and the aforementioned descriptions of abundance, the population is expected to be large.","<em>B. longicaudus</em> occurs in the Andaman and Nicobar islands, <strong>India</strong>, Coco islands, <strong>Myanmar</strong>, peninsular <strong>Thailand</strong>, Sabah, Sarawak and Peninsular <strong>Malaysia</strong>,<strong> Singapore</strong>, Kalimantan (including the Natuna Islands), Sumatra (including the Riau, Enganno, Nias, and Bangka Belitung Islands), <strong>Indonesia,</strong> and <strong>Brunei </strong>(widespread) (Mann 2008, Collar <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020, Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021, eBird 2024).  <p></p>","<p><em>B. longicaudus</em> is threatened by the illegal pet trade, a widespread hobby across the speciesÃ¢ÂÂ range (Jepson and Ladle 2005).

Reportedly, trappers with good relationships with officials or ferry companies can easily ship birds off the island (Iqbal <em>et al.</em> 2020). Birds are also sold to locals and bartered for food or other goods, often being taken directly to Java undetected by authorities (Iqbal <em>et al.</em> 2020). The birds are most often captured with the use of birdlime, or to directly take chicks from the nests (Iqbal<em> et al.</em> 2020). Locals will often feed the birds addictive foods such as coffee or cake, and deprive them of natural foods (i.e., fruit), which encourages captive birds to always return to their cage (Iqbal<em> et al.</em> 2020).&#160;<br/>The price of <em>B. longicaudus</em> was reported in 2020 as 10-14 USD for an adult and 14-18 USD for a chick (Iqbal <em>et al. </em>2020).","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Listed in CITES Appendix II and occurs in numerous protected areas. <p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Research is needed in several areas, including the species population size and trends, the current trend and numbers in the illegal bird trade, and the movements of the species and timing of its utilisation of key habitat sites.

Specifically, the high export of the species from the Kangean Island has caused considerable declines in the population of the subspecies <em>kangeanensis</em>, and with cumulative impacts of habitat degradation, may result in the extinction of the endemic subspecies in the future (Berryman <em>et al.</em> 2024).<br/><br/>Additionally, although the species&#160;utilises secondary regrowth, as well as teak and coconut plantations, rural gardens, parks and urban areas (Juniper and Parr 1998, Neo 2012, Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020), forest loss and degradation is still likely to threaten the species by reducing nest site availability.&#160;The species nests in natural and excavated hollows (Juniper and Parr 1998, Namwong and Gale 2015), generally in taller, healthier trees (Namwong and Gale 2015), which are more abundant in remnant forest. The replacement rate of nesting trees lost by disturbance is likely slow. Observations of cavity excavation by any species was very rarely seen over five years of surveys of nesting birds in western Thailand, suggesting that cavity production is slow (Namwong and Gale 2015). The species largely uses cavities excavated by woodpeckers and barbets, so the nest site availability for <em>P. alexandri</em> will in part be dependent on the population trends of such species (Namwong and Gale 2015).","<em>Psittacula alexandri</em>&#160;is considered common across most of its range, however has undergone declines in Thailand, Lao PDR, Hainan (China) and more recently in Indonesia (Juniper and Parr 1998, Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020, Lewthwaite&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021, Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press). However, the global population has not been quantified, nor have there been any surveys which allow an estimation of the population. Therefore, the population size is unknown.","<em>Psittacula alexandri</em> occurs in south and south-east Asia, from northern and eastern <strong>India</strong> (including the Andaman Islands), <strong>Nepal</strong>, <strong>Bhutan</strong> and <strong>Bangladesh</strong>, ranging through <strong>Myanmar</strong>, <strong>Thailand</strong>,<strong> Laos</strong>, <strong>Cambodia</strong>, <strong>Viet Nam</strong> and southern <strong>China</strong> (including Hainan), and on Sumatra, Java, Bali, and occasionally southern Kalimantan, as well as the islands Karimunjawa, Kangean, Simeulue, Nias, Lasia, and Babi,&#160;<strong>Indonesia&#160;</strong>(Juniper and Parr 1998, Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). Also occurs as a non-native species in high abundance on <strong>Singapore</strong> (Neo 2012, eBird 2024) and Peninsular <strong>Malaysia</strong> (eBird 2024).","As the human population in Indonesia has increased, capturing of parrots for the domestic and international trade has increased in prevalence (Snyder&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2000). Indeed, the species is rarely recorded on Sumatra, and appears only a sporadic visitor to Kalimantan (eBird 2024), as well as now being considered rare on Java and Bali as a result of the cage bird trade (Snyder&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2000, Eaton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). The species is traded online (Okarda&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2022) as well as in markets (e.g. Shepherd 2006) in Indonesia, and in Medan, market trade appears to have increased (Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). The species also appears to be traded between islands, being shipped to Sumatra and Sulawesi (TRAFFIC 2024). Several subspecies confined to smaller islands may now be in danger of becoming extinct. Subspecies <em>perionca </em>on Nias Island (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020) and <em>dammermani</em> on Karimunjawa Island are now considered rare (Susanto 2012 in Eaton&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Trapping of the endemic subspecies <em>kangeanensis </em>on the Kangean Islands is suggested as the principal cause of declines on Kangean, where the species is exported to mainland Java (Berryman&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2024).<br/><br/>Trade is not confined to Indonesia and appears to in part be responsible for declines of the population in Thailand (Collar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). Sunday market surveys in Bangkok from 1966 and 1969 recorded close to 9,000 individuals (McClure and&#160;Chaiyaphun 1971). Comparatively, a survey of markets over a weekend in Bangkok recorded just four individuals in 2015 (Chng and Eaton 2016). While the length of these surveys differs drastically, the stark difference in numbers suggests the species has very likely declined in Thailand since the 1960s, and trade is likely mostly to blame. Similarly, the species was previously widespread on Lao PDR, but has declined to the extent it is now likely absent from Northern Lao PDR (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, Timmins 2014, Collar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020, Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press). The declines in Lao PDR are attributed to the well-established parakeet trade in the country, as well as general persecution (Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press). Further, the species has been recorded in online markets in Viet Nam (Leupen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2022) and was the most recorded native species (133 individuals recorded across 12 separate shops) during surveys over three days in 2016 of all known vendors in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City&#160;(Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2017). Over 3,500 individuals, including adults, nestlings and young, were have also been recorded during the Pagoda Festival in Shwesettaw Wildlife Area in Myanmar (Khaing 2019). The species has declined substantially in Hainan due in part to heavy trade in the 1960s (Lewthwaite&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021) and it is also reportedly targeted for the cage bird trade in Bangladesh (Khaing 2019, TRAFFIC 2024), India (Poonia&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2022, TRAFFIC 2024), and Nepal (Thapa and Thakuri 2009 in Khaing 2019). International trade of the species is also a likely driver of declines, with over one hundred birds seized at the Myanmar border with Yunnan Province, China (Yi-Ming&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2000), and two birds seized from the Thai-Lao PDR border (TRAFFIC 2024). In China, over 50 individuals, including nestlings, were recorded in 2014-2015 surveys in Guiyang (Dai and Zhang 2017) and one individual was seized from a shop in 2014 in Wuhan (TRAFFIC 2024), both incidents outside of the speciesÃ¢ÂÂ current known range. A total of 66,601 live birds were recorded for international trade between 1987 and 1991, predominantly coming from Vietnam (42%), Indonesia (27%) and India (15%), and chiefly going to Singapore (28%), Japan (21%) and USA (12%; Collar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).<br/><br/>The value of <em>P. alexandri </em>individuals has been reported as 28-126 USD (Okarda <em>et al</em>. 2022) and 400.000-700.000 Indonesian Rupiah (Putri <em>et al</em>. 2021) in Indonesia, 1,500 Thai Bhat (Thailand, Chng and Eaton 2016), and 17-22 USD (Vietnam, Leupen <em>et al</em>. 2022).",<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Listed in CITES Appendix II and occurs in numerous protected areas; otherwise no dedicated conservation action is reported.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct regular range-wide surveys to monitor population trends and to determine the population size and number of sub-populations. Surveys of endemic subspecies on Islands are important to understand the risk of local extinctions in these areas. Determine the impact that habitat loss and degradation has on nest-site availability and how this may impact the reproductive success of the population/sub-populations. Quantify the level of trade and impacts of trapping on the population trend. Conduct awareness-raising activities to discourage trapping.

The latter course is preferred, building on Braun&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2016), where several genera were established, including&#160;<em>Himalayapsitta&#160;</em>for&#160;<em>P. finschii</em>,&#160;<em>P. himalayana</em>,&#160;<em>P. roseata&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>P. cyanocephala</em>.","<em>Himalayapsitta finschii </em>is a widespread species that occurs in several different habitat types, including highly modified areas. However, the species is targeted for trade everywhere is occurs, and trade of the species is reportedly causing declines in several regions, most transparently in Laos. Although there has been roughly 15% of forest loss over the last three-generations, the pervasive impacts of trade suggest declines in the range of 20-29% and the species is consequentially listed as Near Threatened.","<em>H. finschii </em>occurs in open mixed deciduous forest, teak forest, secondary regrowth, tea plantations, and cultivated land from 600-1,200 m (Juniper and Parr 1998, Collar and Boesman 2020), and is also tolerant of more open habitats, including hill and mountain habitats (Juniper and Parr 1998, Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press). The species may be recorded down to 100 m in Assam, India, and up to 3,800 m in China (Collar and Boesman 2020). It is more strictly associated with forest in Indochina (Collar and Boesman 2020). Diet reported to include leaf buds and developing fruits, flowers, figs, and grains (Juniper and Parr 1998, Collar and Boesman 2020).","<p>The clearest threat to <em>H. finschii</em> is the pet trade, with reports of the species in trade markets from Myanmar (Khaing 2019), China (Zhang&#160;<em>in litt</em>.&#160;2013 in Khaing 2019), and Lao PDR (Khaing 2019). The clearest impacts of trade are in Lao PDR, where the species has all but disappeared from the north of the country (Fuchs&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2007, Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press). Although the species persists in northern and central Lao PDR, it is still a popular pet in these regions (Thewlis <em>et al</em>. 1998). The species also suffers from nest robbing and hunting for food in Lao PDR (Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press), but the extent of these threats, their prevalence elsewhere are unknown.&#160;</p><p>Although the impacts on the population are not fully understood, habitat loss and degradation are presumed to be impacting the species, considering the intensive nature of these threats within the speciesÃ¢ÂÂ range (Grantham&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2020, Theobald&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2020). Likely, the species will suffer declines as the density of suitable nesting trees are reduced from practices such as selective logging (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000), similar to <em>Psittacula alexandri</em> (Berryman <em>et al.</em> 2024).</p>","There is little information on the population size of this species. It is the most common parrot in some areas of west Myanmar, is locally common in undisturbed areas of Thailand (Collar and Boesman 2020), and is likely the most widespread parakeet in Lao PDR (Timmins 2014) though now appears very scarce in the north (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Fuchs <em>et al</em>. 2007, Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press). In Cambodia, the species is locally common in Mondolkiri, but rare elsewhere and potentially locally extinct from the south-west of the country with only a single historical record (Goes 2013). The species is reportedly uncommon across the rest of its range, and is considered rare in India and Bangladesh (Collar and Boesman 2020), but may be locally common in areas and subject to localised fluctuations in number and occurrence (Juniper and Parr 1998). There have been no surveys that provide or allow an estimation of the population size. Therefore, the current population size is unknown.","<em>H. finschii</em> is distributed from eastern <strong>India</strong>&#160;and <strong>Bangladesh</strong>, through&#160;<strong>Myanmar</strong>, northern and central <strong>Thailand,</strong>&#160;<strong>Cambodia</strong>, <strong>Lao PDR</strong>&#160;(largely absent from the north; Fuchs&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007, Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press), <strong>Viet Nam</strong> and south-western <strong>China</strong>&#160;(Juniper and Parr 1998, Collar and Boesman 2020).","<a name=""_Hlk169786706""><em>H. finschii </em>is threatened by use and trade domestically and internationally (Collar and Boesman 2020, TRAFFIC 2024).&#160;</a><a name=""_Hlk169786706"">In Thailand, trade has likely been the main cause of declines&#160;(</a>Juniper and Parr 1998<a name=""_Hlk169786706"">).&#160;</a>Sunday market surveys in Bangkok from 1966 and 1969 recorded over 2,000 individuals (McClure and&#160;Chaiyaphun 1971) but a survey of markets over a weekend in Bangkok in 2015 did not record the species (Chng and Eaton 2016).&#160;While the length of these surveys differ, the differences suggest the species has very likely declined in Thailand since the 1960s, and trade is likely partially to blame. The species is a popular household pet, and traded widely as such in Myanmar (Khaing 2019). Surveys from December 2018 to April 2019 during the&#160;Pagoda Festival in Shwesettaw Wildlife Area in Myanmar recorded over 1,000 individuals,&#160;including adults, nestlings, and young (Khaing 2019). Apparently, most international trade of the species stems from Myanmar, with 917 recorded from 1987-1992 (Collar and Boesman 2020). Similarly, poaching and illegal trade is common in China, with reports from one village stating that every family kept the bird as pet (Zhang<em>&#160;in litt.</em>&#160;2013 in Khaing 2019). Trade is likely to blame for the species' decline in northern Lao PDR, along with nest robbery and hunting for food (Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press). Although the species does still persist in greatly reduced numbers through southern and central Lao PDR (Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press), they are still popular pets in these regions (Thewlis&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1998).

Moreover, <em>P. iris</em> has the pale greenish-yellow hindcollar shown by most members of the Rainbow Lorikeet <em>T. haematodus</em> complex. The continuous purplish-blue postocular line and ear-coverts is shared with <em>T. ornatus</em> while, viewed ventrally, <em>P. iris</em> is most similar, among all species of <em>Psitteuteles</em> and <em>Trichoglossus</em>, to <em>P. euteles</em>, with which it co-occurs on Timor (elevationally separate).

Over the past three generations forest loss has caused a reduction in tree cover of <em>c</em>.5-7% in this species' range (Global Forest Watch 2024, based on data from Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2013 and methods therein), which has largely been driven by local-scale shifting agriculture and clearance for plantations, almost entirely on Timor (Wetar has remained intact). The extent to which trapping affects wild populations is effectively unknown, but there is evidence for local (C. Trainor <em>in litt</em>. 2024), regional (e.g. Shepherd 2006) and international (Emerson <em>et al</em>. 2022, Donald <em>et al</em>. 2024) trade in this species.<p></p>","Described by Eaton <em>et al</em>.

Numbers at least locally may be suppressed by trapping pressure, but this does not appear to be a large threat to this species. The area of suitable habitat across its range is between 6,000-8,000 km<sup>2</sup>, depending on the habitat classes included in the calculation (Jung <em>et al</em>. 2020), but it is suspected that birds are somewhat nomadic in response to the availability of flowering trees. Based on surveys in the 1990s, Juniper and Parr (1998) estimated a population of 'around 10,000 birds'. Out of an abundance of caution, a population size of 7,500-20,000 mature individuals is estimated here to incorporate the suggestion of Juniper and Parr (1998), but also to allow for the possibility (considered likely) that their suggestion was overly pessimistic.","<em>Trichoglossus iris</em> is restricted to Timor and Wetar, <strong>Indonesia </strong>and <strong>Timor-Leste</strong> (BirdLife International 2001, Mauro 2003).<p></p>","Poorly understood, but this species is evidently trapped for the pet trade, as are most Wallacean parrots.

Local human population increases, resulting from transmigration (e.g. near Nabire and Jayapura), have increased logging and land clearance for agriculture <strong></strong>(R.

In addition, recent information suggests that this species may be secure in the large  areas of inaccessible forest within its range: it was recently found to be  fairly common in the lowland forests along the Idenburg and Ruffaer  rivers and it is noted that large-scale oil palm  cultivation has not yet taken hold in the heart of the Mamberamo (B.
